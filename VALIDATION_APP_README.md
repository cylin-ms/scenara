## Tips for Validation

### High Confidence Cases
If both models agree and have high confidence (>95%), they're likely correct. Quick validation!

### Disagreement Cases
When models disagree, these are the most interesting:
- Meeting 1: "[Async Task]" - Informational vs Status Update
- Meeting 3: "Meeting Prep STCA Sync" - Status vs Planning

Pay special attention to these edge cases.

### Common Patterns
- **"Meeting Prep"** â†’ Usually Planning Sessions
- **"Sync"** â†’ Could be Status Update or Planning (context matters)
- **"Office Hours"** â†’ Usually Informational Briefings
- **"Weekly Review"** â†’ Progress Review Meetings
- **"1:1" / "1-on-1"** â†’ One-on-One Meetings

### Ambiguous Meetings
If a meeting genuinely fits multiple types:
- Choose the PRIMARY purpose (>50% of meeting)
- Add notes explaining the ambiguity
- Rate as "Hard" difficulty

## Expected Time

- **5-10 minutes** for all 8 meetings
- **~1 minute per meeting** average
- Quick validation for clear cases
- More time for ambiguous cases

## Next Steps After Validation

Once you complete all 8 meetings:

1. **Review Statistics**
   - Check GPT-5 vs Copilot accuracy
   - Identify which model performed better
   - Compare to 87.5% cross-model agreement

2. **Export Results**
   - Download validation JSON
   - Use for further analysis
   - Reference for prompt refinement

3. **Analyze Errors**
   - Review error patterns
   - Identify taxonomy gaps
   - Suggest prompt improvements

4. **Update Prompt** (if needed)
   - Add rules for common errors
   - Clarify ambiguous type definitions
   - Re-run experiments

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no dependencies)
- **Storage**: JSON files (no database needed)
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable)
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled in debug mode

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```powershell
# Kill process on port 5000
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process
```

### Flask Not Found
```powershell
pip install flask
```

### Can't Access from Other Devices
The app runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` so it's accessible from other devices on your network.
Find your IP and navigate to `http://YOUR_IP:5000`

## Development

To modify the app:

1. **Backend Logic**: Edit `validation_app.py`
2. **Frontend UI**: Edit `templates/validation.html`
3. **Styling**: Modify `<style>` section in template
4. **API**: Add endpoints in `validation_app.py`

Changes to templates reload automatically in debug mode.
