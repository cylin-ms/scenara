# RyanPrompts

_A curated set of prompts to analyze and optimize your day, meetings, and time allocation._

## 1) What truly matters today

Look at my entire calendar for today and tell me what truly matters most. Highlight the meetings I must absolutely prepare for, flag anything that looks overbooked or unrealistic, and suggest what I can cancel, reschedule, or delegate to free up focus time. Then give me a quick summary showing how my day aligns with my priorities and how much of it is meetings versus real work.

---

## 2) 30‑second briefing for each meeting

Give me a 30-second briefing for each of my meetings today — who’s attending, what we discussed last time, key open items, and likely topics to come up based on the agenda or context. Include links to any related documents or threads, and remind me what I committed to in previous meetings with these people.

---

## 3) Make my calendar smarter

Analyze my calendar and make it smarter. Recommend ways to group related meetings, reduce context switching, and automatically protect focus time after busy days. Suggest reschedules or shorter durations for low-ROI meetings based on outcomes, attendance, and frequency. If possible, forecast how my week would change if I adjusted those recurring meetings.

---

## 4) Time‑spend insights

Give me insights from my calendar that show how I’m really spending my time. Who do I meet with most — and who am I neglecting? How much of my time goes to strategy versus execution or management versus individual work? Highlight patterns that suggest I’m operating reactively instead of proactively, and suggest one or two adjustments to bring my time more in line with my stated priorities.
