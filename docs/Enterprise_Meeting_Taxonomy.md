## Background: Meeting Types and Current Tools

Over decades, business experts and collaboration platforms have identified recurring patterns in meeting purposes. Many sources categorize meetings by their primary objective. For example, MeetingSift (a meeting collaboration tool) defines six common meeting types: Status Update, Information Sharing, Decision Making, Problem Solving, Innovation, and Team Building . These map to intuitive purposes: updating people on progress, sharing knowledge, making decisions, solving issues, generating ideas, and building team cohesion. In practice, however, meetings often blend purposes, and additional categories are needed for specific contexts (like sales calls or training sessions). Indeed.com’s list of common business meetings includes types like strategy planning, all-hands meetings, change announcement meetings, and initiative rollout meetings  – underscoring that one flat list isn’t enough.

To get more specific, Elise Keith of Lucid Meetings proposed a robust taxonomy with 16 distinct meeting types grouped into higher-level families :

Cadence Meetings – regular recurring meetings that drive execution and alignment (e.g. team check-ins, status reviews, one-on-ones, action retrospectives, and governance reviews).

Catalyst Meetings – ad-hoc, purpose-driven meetings to create change (e.g. idea brainstorming, planning sessions, workshops, problem-solving discussions, decision meetings).

Learning/Influence Meetings – meetings to share information, learn, or influence others, often spanning internal/external boundaries (e.g. sensemaking interviews, community-of-practice forums, introductory “meet and greets,” issue resolution negotiations, training sessions, and broadcast announcements) .

This taxonomy is quite comprehensive – it spans everything from a daily team huddle to a board meeting or an investor pitch. It highlights that Fortune 500 companies share many meeting archetypes, even across industries. For instance, a “safety briefing” in manufacturing or healthcare is essentially an informational team cadence meeting, while a “client QBR” (quarterly business review) in a tech firm is a structured governance meeting. Likewise, a product brainstorming meeting in a retail company and an R&D ideation session in a pharma company are both idea-generation catalyst meetings.

Current meeting software and services generally do not auto-classify meetings by type, but they provide features hinting at categories. For example, Google Calendar and Outlook let users tag events or mark “#1:1” in titles for one-on-ones, and scheduling tools like Calendly allow organizers to define meeting types (e.g. “Sales Call” vs “Project Sync”) manually. Microsoft’s Viva Insights analytics can distinguish internal vs external meetings, large vs small meetings, and track meeting habits (it even offers “meeting category insights”) to managers. Major conferencing platforms differentiate meeting formats – e.g. Zoom’s “webinar” mode vs regular meeting – which corresponds to our taxonomy’s distinction between a broadcast-style meeting versus a collaborative discussion. There is also emerging AI assistance: for instance, Google’s Duet AI for Workspace and Microsoft 365 Copilot can extract the meeting agenda or suggest action items, but they rely on contextual understanding (and presumably an implicit taxonomy of meeting intents) to do so. Interestingly, Google’s own documentation once cited MeetingSift’s six meeting types as a definitive guide, indicating that leading companies see value in organizing meetings by type. However, no single vendor’s toolset today fully covers an automatic classification of meeting purpose – this remains an area for improvement via AI.

## Comprehensive Enterprise Meeting Taxonomy

Leveraging insights from these frameworks and real-world practices, we propose a multi-level taxonomy of meeting types. The taxonomy has broad categories to capture overarching context (like participants and formality) and detailed subtypes to capture the meeting’s goal. This structure is designed to cover ~95% of meetings in large organizations:

### 1. Internal Recurring Meetings (Cadence)

These are regular, within-organization meetings that occur on a repeating cadence to keep work on track and teams aligned.

Team Status Update Meetings: Routine check-ins for project or team progress. Example: weekly team meeting, daily stand-up, shift-change huddle. Purpose is to share updates, surface blockers, and synchronize the group . These are usually short, structured, and involve all team members.

Progress Review Meetings: More formal review of project/status metrics, often monthly or milestone-based. Examples: project status review, program portfolio review, or client checkpoint meeting . Focus is on accountability against plans; surprises are unwelcome as the goal is to ensure things are on track.

One-on-One Meetings: Regular 1:1s between two people (commonly manager and direct report, but also mentor-mentee or peer check-ins). These emphasize individual progress, feedback, and relationship-building. Example: a weekly manager-employee one-on-one, coaching sessions, or skip-level meetings. They tend to be conversational and informal in structure, yet crucial for performance management and employee engagement.

Action Review Meetings: Periodic retrospectives or post-mortems to learn from recent work and improve. Examples: sprint retrospective in engineering, after-action review (AAR) in military contexts, incident post-mortem, or a sales win/loss analysis. They focus on analyzing outcomes and generating recommendations for change.

Governance & Strategy Cadence: High-level periodic meetings for leadership oversight and strategic alignment. Examples: quarterly business review (QBR) between a vendor and client, executive leadership team meeting, or board of directors meeting. These are formal, agenda-driven meetings to review performance, compliance, or strategy, often with pre-read materials and recorded minutes.

### 2. Strategic Planning & Decision Meetings

These are typically scheduled as needed (ad hoc) and focused on making decisions or setting plans for the future. They often involve specific prep and the right mix of stakeholders.

Planning Sessions: Meetings where the primary goal is to develop a plan or roadmap. Examples include annual strategy planning, project planning kickoff, product roadmap meeting, campaign planning in marketing, or an initiative scoping meeting . Often facilitated by a project owner or external facilitator, these meetings require brainstorming options, evaluating resources, and aligning on a concrete plan.

Decision-Making Meetings: Gatherings explicitly held to make a decision on a significant issue . For instance, a hiring committee meeting to select a new hire, a go/no-go launch decision, or an architecture review board deciding on a technical approach. Such meetings should have the decision criteria defined and all decision-makers present. Preparation is key – attendees are expected to come with necessary background info so the group can decide in-meeting.

Problem-Solving / Incident Resolution Meetings: Tackling a specific problem or crisis. Examples: an urgent incident response meeting (IT outage war-room, PR crisis meeting), a cross-departmental meeting to resolve a process breakdown, or a customer escalation resolution . The aim is to identify the root cause and agree on a solution and action steps. These meetings can be intense and may blend into decision meetings (once a solution is agreed) or spawn follow-up actions.

Brainstorming / Innovation Meetings: Creative idea-generation sessions exploring new concepts or solving open-ended challenges . Examples: product brainstorming, design thinking workshop, “blue sky” innovation meeting, or ad-hoc brainstorming for marketing campaigns. Often run by a facilitator, these encourage free thinking, use methods like whiteboarding or sticky notes, and defer judgment – the goal is a wealth of ideas which can later be culled.

Workshops & Design Sessions: Longer-format meetings (sometimes multi-hour or multi-day) to collaborate on a complex task or develop a tangible output. Examples: project kickoff workshop, design sprint session, value-stream mapping workshop, or a team offsite to solve a challenge. Workshops typically have interactive exercises, breakout groups, and are highly structured to produce a result (a design, a plan, a set of priorities) by the end. They require planning and often a skilled facilitator.

### 3. External & Client-Facing Meetings

These involve people from outside the organization, such as clients, partners, vendors, or job candidates. They often have a different dynamic (more formal, relationship-focused) and objectives tied to external business goals.

Sales & Client Meetings: Interactions with customers or clients to advance business development or manage accounts. This subtype includes sales pitch meetings, product demos, client check-in/status meetings, quarterly business reviews (with clients), and account renewal/negotiation meetings. The purpose may range from pitching a proposal, understanding client needs, providing project updates to a client, to negotiating contracts. Such meetings are typically external-facing and success is measured by client satisfaction or deal progress.

Vendor/Supplier Meetings: Meetings with suppliers or service providers. Examples: vendor negotiation sessions, supplier performance review meetings, or onboarding meetings with a new vendor. These can be akin to client meetings but the power dynamic may differ (your company is the client). They often focus on ensuring service quality, discussing terms, or resolving any delivery issues.

Partnership/Business Development Meetings: Strategic meetings with potential partners, investors, or other external stakeholders. For example, an investor pitch meeting, an alliance discussion, or a merger due-diligence meeting. These are high-stakes and often decision-oriented (e.g. will the investor fund the project?).

Interviews and Recruiting Meetings: When the “external” party is a job candidate or external hire. This includes HR phone screens, technical interviews, and final panel interviews. The structure differs (Q&A format, evaluation forms) but as meetings, they aim to gather information (about the candidate) and make a decision (hire or not). This overlaps with decision-meeting taxonomy, but is worth noting separately since many Fortune 500 firms have heavy interview schedules.

Client Training or Onboarding: Sessions where an external party is being educated or onboarded. For instance, training a client on a new product they purchased (common in B2B software), or onboarding a new customer with a walkthrough. This is a hybrid of an external meeting and a training meeting, often one-to-many with a presentation/demo format .

### 4. Informational & Broadcast Meetings

These meetings are primarily about one-way information dissemination or training, often with a large audience. Interaction is limited; the goal is to share knowledge consistently to many people.

All-Hands / Town Hall Meetings: Company-wide or organization-wide meetings where leadership addresses all employees (or all hands in a division). Purpose is to communicate company results, strategic updates, or big announcements, and to rally the organization. They typically include presentations by executives and a Q&A segment . These meetings are large (hundreds or thousands of attendees) and are often webcasted or held in auditorium settings. They fall under broadcast-style in our taxonomy (information flows mostly one-way).

Informational Briefings: Meetings called to announce or explain a specific piece of information or change. For example, a meeting to announce an organizational change (reorg, policy update), to introduce a new company policy/tool, or to brief a specific group on a completed project’s findings. These are usually short and focused on a few key messages . The “all-hands” is a special case covering broad topics; an informational briefing might be narrower (e.g. a department head explaining a new procedure to their team).

Training & Education Sessions: Meetings dedicated to skill or knowledge training, which can be internal or external. Internally, this could be employee training on compliance, safety, or new software. Externally, as mentioned, it could be training customers. Format often involves a presentation or live demonstration and sometimes interactive elements or Q&A. These meetings have a clear teacher/student dynamic; success is when attendees understand the material.

Webinars and Broadcasts: In some cases, companies hold webinar-style meetings for either employees or customers to share information. For example, a marketing team might host a webinar for potential clients (which is more like an event, but essentially a meeting with Q&A). Internally, a “Lunch and Learn” session where an expert shares knowledge is similar. The Lucid taxonomy calls these “Broadcasts”: minimal audience participation, mainly to inspire or inform.

### 5. Team-Building & Culture Meetings

These meetings focus on strengthening relationships, team cohesion, and company culture rather than on immediate business goals.

Team-Building Activities: Meetings explicitly designed to build camaraderie. Examples: team offsite meetings, team-building workshops with games or challenges, ice-breaker sessions for a newly formed team, or virtual team bonding activities. They may be informal (a virtual happy hour) or formal (a facilitated team dynamics workshop). While not “work” in the task sense, Fortune 500 firms recognize these as important for morale and collaboration .

Recognition & Social Events: These border on “meetings” but often appear on calendars – e.g. an employee recognition ceremony, a retirement send-off meeting, or a casual “catch-up” meeting between colleagues. They serve to maintain relationships (“relationship maintenance” was noted as a goal of one-on-ones and some cadence meetings too). We include them because they are common – e.g., a manager might schedule a biweekly informal coffee chat with each team member (part one-on-one, part social check-in). They usually have no formal agenda other than connection.

Communities of Practice & Networking Meets: These are sessions where people across teams gather around a common interest or role, often semi-social and for knowledge exchange. For example, a monthly meetup of all project managers to share tips (internal community of practice), or a “Lunch and Learn” open to anyone interested in data science . These have overlapping aspects of information sharing and networking. They are often voluntary-attendance and meant to spread ideas in a low-pressure environment.

Coverage and Flexibility: With these categories and subtypes, we cover a vast range of meeting scenarios. Notably, many real meetings combine elements of multiple types – for instance, a weekly team meeting (status update) might allocate time for a brainstorm (idea generation) on a new problem, or a planning workshop might also involve some team-building exercises. Our taxonomy is meant to be applied in a flexible, possibly multi-label manner if needed. However, each meeting usually has a primary purpose that dictates how it should be run and what outcomes are expected. The above types focus on that primary intent.

Before moving on, the next section summarizes these meeting types in a table mapping each type to its typical purpose, relevant software support, and AI/ML classification considerations. This serves as a quick reference and bridges into discussing the AI models.

## Meeting Types Mapped to Use Cases, Tools, and AI Approaches

The table below lists the key meeting types (as identified in our taxonomy) alongside their common use cases, how current software supports them, and the kinds of AI/ML techniques that would be suitable to detect or support each type.

Notes: The “Software Support” column indicates how current tools recognize or facilitate each meeting type (it highlights that true automatic classification is not widely implemented – user input is common). The “AI/ML Aids” column suggests features and model types; in practice, a robust classifier would combine multiple features (text of invite, participants, timing, past similar meetings, etc.) under a machine learning model to determine the meeting category. Real-time prediction (at scheduling time) might lean more on metadata (participants, keywords), while post-meeting analysis can leverage transcript content and interaction signals – further discussed next.

## AI/ML Models for Meeting Classification

To automatically classify meetings by type, AI models should be chosen or designed for two stages: (a) real-time or scheduling-time classification, and (b) post-meeting classification (after transcripts/notes are available). Different data is available at these stages, so a combination of approaches is ideal:

Scheduling-Time Classification: At the time a meeting is being created (or right before it occurs), we mainly have the meeting invite information – title, description/agenda (if provided), organizer and invitee identities, date/time, recurrence pattern, etc. AI can use natural language processing (NLP) on the title/agenda text and metadata features to predict the likely meeting type. A suitable model here is a text classification model (for example, a fine-tuned Transformer like BERT or a smaller language model suited for classification) that takes the invite text as input. It can be supplemented with structured features (like number of attendees, whether external domains are present, duration, recurrence) by concatenating them into the model input or using an ensemble. For instance, an XGBoost or random forest classifier could combine the NLP-derived features with those structured signals. Real-time classification needs to be fast and lightweight (to give instant suggestions as the user schedules). Therefore, one approach is to maintain a library of keywords/phrases for quick initial classification (e.g., detect “1:1” vs “staff meeting” vs “QBR” in the title) combined with a lightweight ML model for less obvious cases.

Example: If the organizer is adding a meeting titled “Q3 Roadmap Planning Session,” an NLP classifier can identify “planning” and classify it as a Planning Meeting (Strategic category). It might also notice all invitees are internal and it’s 2 hours long, reinforcing that it’s an internal planning workshop. The system could then suggest an agenda template suited for planning meetings.

Additionally, graph-based features can help in real-time: using the org chart to see relationships (to identify one-on-ones or team meetings), or past meeting patterns for that team. For example, if a meeting is part of a series (same title weekly), the model should recognize it as a recurring cadence meeting even if the title is generic. Microsoft’s analytics show using just header metadata can reveal meeting characteristics like manager 1:1 time or large collaborative meetings .

Modern large language models (LLMs) could also be employed in a few-shot manner: provide the meeting details as prompt and ask an LLM (like GPT-4 or an enterprise-tuned model) to categorize the meeting. This might yield good results given LLMs’ general knowledge of meeting types, but for consistency and speed in enterprise use, a fine-tuned smaller model is likely better.

Post-Meeting Classification: After the meeting, we can leverage the meeting content – transcripts from video conferencing (if recorded or transcribed live), chat logs, notes, and outcomes. This is useful for validating or refining the classification (some meetings evolve away from their scheduled intent) and for triggering relevant post-meeting automation (e.g., if it was a decision meeting, ensure decisions are documented; if it was a brainstorming, maybe store the ideas someplace). Speech and text analytics play a role here. For instance, an AI could analyze the transcript to see if the conversation was primarily one-way vs multi-party (broadcast vs discussion), or if certain keywords and speech acts occurred (did people say “let’s vote” or “action item” – signs of decision meetings and action-oriented outcomes).

For transcript analysis, transformer-based language models are state-of-the-art. A model like BERT or RoBERTa fine-tuned on meeting transcripts labeled by type could classify the meeting after the fact. Researchers have indeed explored meeting understanding tasks: while much focus is on summarization and action item extraction, those same techniques can support classification. For example, an AI can first generate an extractive summary of key points and then classify the summary into a category (this two-step approach might handle long transcript lengths better). There has even been work on using video analysis of meetings to classify type – e.g., a computer vision approach looked at participant motions and behaviors in meeting videos to distinguish meeting types like presentations vs discussions vs negotiations . In a board meeting, for instance, one person speaks at length (presentation behavior) whereas a brainstorming has lots of people jumping in (dynamic interaction). Such non-verbal cues coupled with audio features (who speaks when, overlap, tone) can feed into classification. Models like HMMs or LSTMs were traditionally used for sequential data like speaker changes; now one could use a combination of an NLP model for content and a sequence model for turn-taking patterns.

Another AI approach is topic modeling or clustering to discover meeting themes. Tools like BERTopic (which combines transformers and clustering) can group transcripts or even invite texts into clusters of similar content . This unsupervised method might reveal latent categories (for example, it might find one cluster of meetings frequently discusses “action items” and “project update” – clearly status meetings, versus another cluster with lots of “brainstorm” and creative terms). While not a replacement for our defined taxonomy, such techniques can validate that our categories make sense on real data and help adjust boundaries (for instance, discovering a need for a new category if one cluster doesn’t fit well).

Importantly, AI can do more than classification once it knows the meeting type. For example, classification can feed into meeting-specific AI actions: a system could automatically enable certain features if it detects a brainstorming meeting (like launching a whiteboard automatically), or flag that a decision meeting did not record any decision in the notes (prompting the organizer afterward). In this way, the taxonomy powers productivity improvements.

For model selection: supervised learning with a labeled dataset of meetings (where each meeting is tagged with a type) is the straightforward path. Such a dataset can be bootstrapped from user-labeled meeting types (if users tag their events) or by heuristics to auto-label a set for training (e.g., treat all meetings with only two attendees as tentative one-on-ones to train an initial classifier). Ensembles combining rules and ML might yield the best precision by leveraging human domain knowledge (e.g., always classify an event titled “All Hands” as All-hands).

Real-time systems likely use a mix of rules, ML classifiers, and semantic search. For instance, an AI scheduling assistant might have a knowledge base of meeting type definitions (an ontology) and use a rule-based reasoner (does the invite match the ontology patterns?) combined with an ML confidence score. This combination ensures efficiency and the ability to handle edge cases by explicit rules.

Finally, advanced contextual models can incorporate user-specific patterns: one team’s “Team Sync” might function as a status update, while another team uses “Team Sync” for brainstorming. A personalized model could learn these nuances per team. Large enterprises could deploy federated learning where each department’s meeting data fine-tunes the model without sharing raw content (to address privacy). Speaking of which, we now discuss the challenges and pitfalls in implementing such classification AI.

## Challenges and Potential Pitfalls in Meeting Classification

Implementing an AI-powered meeting taxonomy is promising, but several challenges must be acknowledged:

Imprecise or Evolving Taxonomy Definitions: The boundaries between meeting types can be fuzzy. One person’s “status update” might be another’s “information sharing.” As organizations evolve, new meeting formats appear (e.g., “DevOps stand-up” is a twist on status meeting; “innovation day” meetings that don’t cleanly fit the old categories). The taxonomy must be revisited periodically to remain relevant. Otherwise, an AI could misclassify simply because the schema is outdated. Solution: use feedback loops – if users frequently correct the AI or label a meeting as “Other,” update the taxonomy or model.

Dataset Bias and Coverage: Training an ML model requires a representative dataset. If the training data comes mostly from one department or one company culture, the model might be biased. For example, if all training examples of “strategy meetings” come from tech companies, the model might miss that in finance companies those are called “investment committee meetings” (terminology differences). Ensuring the model sees examples across industries (Fortune 500 breadth) is tough. It may be necessary to allow customization per company. The taxonomy claims to cover 95% of meeting types – but the 5% edge cases (say, highly specialized meetings like a pharmaceutical clinical trial review meeting) might be critical in certain businesses. Solution: allow an “Other” category and capture new patterns; make the model easily extensible with new training for uncovered types.

Real-time Constraints: In scheduling scenarios, the AI must work within UX constraints. If an assistant pops up “I think this is a Decision Meeting; do you need a decision document template?” and it’s wrong, it interrupts the user. The system should probably gently assist rather than enforce. Perhaps it can auto-fill a suggested category that users can ignore or change. Also, real-time means computation needs to be efficient – a cloud NLP call for every meeting typed might be costly at enterprise scale. Edge cases like recurring series where each occurrence evolves (one week is brainstorming, next week is decision) are also tricky – the AI might need to classify at the occurrence level, not assume all in series are identical.

Integration with Existing Tools: Even if we classify a meeting well, integrating that into workflow is a challenge. Ideally, the meeting’s type would inform other systems (like how the calendar or Teams behaves). Without deep integration, taxonomy might stay as a label without action. But integrating could require changes in calendar schema, user training to see/use the info, and so on. It’s both a technical and change-management challenge.

Evaluation and Ground Truth: Measuring success of meeting type classification is non-trivial. There’s no absolute “correct” label in some cases, and organizers themselves might disagree on what type a meeting was. This can make supervised learning labels noisy. It also complicates evaluating the AI – should it be judged by alignment with organizer intention or with an external definition? A potential pitfall is declaring a type and then shaping user behavior incorrectly (imagine the AI labels something a “status meeting” and thus doesn’t prompt for a decision, but the team actually needed to make a decision in it). Mitigation: involve user input – e.g., allow users to select or confirm the meeting type (maybe as a simple question “What’s the goal of this meeting?” when creating an event – though that adds friction). Use this input to continually refine the AI’s understanding.

Multi-label Classification Complexity: As noted, some meetings legitimately belong to multiple categories (a common scenario is a combined status + decision meeting). Our taxonomy is hierarchical, but an AI might need to output more than one label or a confidence distribution. Designing the system outputs and subsequent automation to handle combinations increases complexity (for example, if a meeting is both “Status Update” and “Decision”, AI might need to enable features for both: status tracking and decision logging). This is more complex than a single-label classification task. A pitfall would be oversimplifying the problem to single-label and thereby losing important nuance.

Handling of Edge Cases and Errors: There will be meetings with scant info (title: “Misc” scheduled by someone) – AI might default classify it as a generic internal meeting. If that meeting was actually with a customer but the organizer didn’t add the customer on the invite yet, the AI could be wrong. Systems must handle such low-confidence cases gracefully, possibly by asking for disambiguation (“Is this meeting with an external party?”). The challenge is to do this without annoying users too much.

Adaptability to Changing Meeting Practices: The past few years have shown rapid shifts – e.g., the rise of fully virtual meetings, hybrid meetings, new etiquette like Zoom webinars for big announcements, etc. AI models need continuous updating. A taxonomy and model developed in 2023 might need expansion by 2025 (perhaps “AI review meetings” where humans and AI meet might be a new type!). Organizations also differ: some adopt no-meeting days or replace certain meetings with async communication – the taxonomy could then influence how AI suggests alternatives (like telling a user “This status update could be an email instead” – a potentially smart but delicate recommendation!).

In summary, implementing an AI-driven meeting type classification system must be done with careful consideration of human factors and enterprise context. The taxonomy presented here provides a foundation and, with the right AI models, can drive meeting-specific customizations that improve productivity and meeting effectiveness. But success requires treating the taxonomy as a living framework, using a combination of NLP, structured data analysis, and user feedback, and addressing privacy/acceptance from day one. When done right, the payoff is significant: employees get intelligent assistance tailored to whether they’re in a brainstorm versus a board meeting, and organizations benefit from more purposeful, effective meetings rather than the one-size-fits-all approach that often leads to the staggering percentage of unproductive meetings we see today. With a solid taxonomy and modern AI, we can make meetings smarter – and maybe even give people some of that 5+ hours a week back.
