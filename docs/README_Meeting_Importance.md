# Meeting Importance Analysis System

## Overview

The Meeting Importance Analysis System is an AI-powered time management feature that automatically assigns importance scores (1-10) to calendar events. This intelligent scoring system drives critical productivity features including auto-rescheduling, auto-RSVP decisions, and meeting prioritization.

## Purpose

This system helps users:
- **Prioritize their time** by automatically identifying the most important meetings
- **Make informed scheduling decisions** through intelligent importance scoring
- **Automate calendar management** with features like auto-RSVP and rescheduling
- **Focus on high-value activities** by surfacing critical meetings and events

## Scoring System

### Score Range
- **Scale**: 1-10 (1 = least important, 10 = most important)
- **Buckets**:
  - **1-4**: Low Importance
  - **5-7**: Medium Importance  
  - **8-10**: High Importance

### Scoring Philosophy
The system follows a **"High Importance Override"** principle: If any high importance signals are detected, the meeting MUST be scored as high importance (8-10), even if low importance signals are also present.

## High Importance Signals (Score: 8-10)

### üî¥ Critical Meeting Types
- **1-on-1 meetings** or small group sessions
- **Interviews and hiring decisions**
- **Planning and strategic meetings**
- **Meetings organized by you** (the user)

### üë• Key People Involvement
- **Direct reporting chain**: Manager, skip manager, or direct reports
- **Important attendees**: Individuals listed in ImportantRequiredAttendees
- **User as organizer**: Events created by the user

### üìã Content & Context
- **Similar to past important events**: Subject/content matches EarlierImportantMeetings
- **Explicit high importance label**: Organizer marked as "High" importance
- **Personal appointments**: OOF, medical appointments, family obligations
- **Reminders**: Task deadlines and important reminders

### ‚è∞ Timing Factors
- **Last-minute meetings**: If base score is 5-7 and meeting is last-minute, add +3 to score

## Low Importance Signals (Score: 1-4)

### üìâ Indicators of Lower Priority
- **Explicit low importance label**: Organizer marked as "Low" importance
- **Optional attendee status**: User is optional (unless overridden by high importance signals)
- **Large group meetings**: Big meetings without strategic importance
- **Personal time blocks**: Focus time, lunch, breaks (unless strategically protected)
- **Informational events**: Organized by others for information sharing

## Special Considerations

### Office Hours Handling
- **Not automatically low importance**: System checks historical user engagement
- **Context-aware scoring**: Analyzes subject, organizer, and past acceptance patterns
- **Fallback to medium/low**: Only if no strong importance signals are found

### Email Alias Consolidation
The system treats multiple email aliases as the same person:
- `MarkWhite@test.com`
- `MArk.White@test.com` 
- `mwhite@test.com`

### Optional Attendee Intelligence
Even if marked as optional, meetings can still receive high importance scores if:
- Subject/agenda indicates strategic importance
- Key people are involved
- Content matches historically important events
