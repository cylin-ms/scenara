        "range": "6-6",
        "reasoning": "The task requires multiple steps: (1) identify the upcoming meeting with customer Beta from the calendar, (2) retrieve attendee list, (3) enrich each attendee with a dossier (role, LinkedIn, past interactions), (4) infer topics of interest from historical emails/meetings or CRM data, and (5) generate a company background. Current AI models can handle text generation and summarization well, but the challenge lies in secure data access, entity resolution, and topic inference from sparse signals. APIs exist for calendars (Google, Outlook), LinkedIn-like enrichment (via third-party APIs), and CRM integration, but orchestration and privacy compliance add complexity.",

        "reasoning": "Verification is relatively straightforward because the output can be checked against known facts: attendee names, company background from authoritative sources, and whether the brief includes requested sections. Users can quickly validate correctness by scanning the brief. Automated checks can confirm presence of required components and factual consistency with CRM and public data.",

        "reasoning": "We can generate synthetic briefs from historical meeting notes and CRM data, and use human-in-the-loop validation for quality. Public company profiles and LinkedIn-like datasets can supplement training. However, topic inference from sparse signals may require semi-supervised or retrieval-augmented approaches.",
