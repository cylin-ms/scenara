## Executive Summary

You evaluated all 9 hero prompt execution plans generated by GPT-5. Your findings reveal **critical framework issues** that require immediate attention:

### Overall Quality
- ✅ **Correct Plans**: 6/9 (67%)
- ⚠️ **Partially Correct**: 3/9 (33%)
- ❌ **Incorrect Plans**: 0/9 (0%)

### Critical Findings

1. **⚠️ CAN-02 Meeting Classification Conflation** (Mentioned 4 times)
   - Lumps together "meeting type" and "meeting importance/priority"
   - These are fundamentally different capabilities that should be separated

2. **⚠️ 20% of Canonical Tasks Never Used**
   - 4 out of 20 tasks (CAN-07, CAN-17, CAN-18, CAN-20) not in any execution plan
   - Contradicts expectation since tasks came from analyzing the same 9 prompts

3. **⚠️ Missing Universal Task (CAN-04)**
   - Natural Language Understanding missing from organizer-3
   - You correctly noted: "Isn't NLP needed for all prompts?"

4. **⚠️ New Capabilities Needed**
   - Task duration estimation (organizer-2)
   - Who works on what discovery (collaborate-1)
   - Conflict resolution (schedule-1)

## Detailed Evaluation Results

### Organizer Category (3 prompts)

#### organizer-1: "Show me my pending invitations and which ones I should prioritize..."
**Rating**: ✅ Correct  
**Steps**: 4 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-02, CAN-11

**Your Comments**:
- Step 2 (CAN-02): "The meeting classification lump two types: the meeting type and meeting priority. They are separate capability."

**Analysis**:
- Clean execution flow: NLU → Retrieve → Classify → Match Preferences
- No missing steps identified
- Main issue: CAN-02 definition needs refinement

---

#### organizer-2: "I have some important meetings this week—flag the ones I need to prep for..."
**Rating**: ✅ Correct  
**Steps**: 5 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-02, CAN-14, CAN-03

**Your Comments**:
- Step 3 (CAN-02): "So CAN-02 'Meeting Classification' includes both 'meeting type' and 'meeting importance'. From last time, we think they are separate capabilities."
- **Missing Task**: "To answer this prompt, the system needs to have the capability of estimating the time for this individual to finish the preparation. This is not easy to estimate. But it needs to have some idea of how much time a person typically needs to reserve to finish a particular task."

**Analysis**:
- Execution flow correct: NLU → Retrieve → Classify → Recommend → Create Prep Blocks
- **Critical gap**: No capability for estimating prep duration
- Need new task: **CAN-21: Task Duration Estimation**

#### organizer-3: "Show me patterns in the kinds of meetings that fill up my week..."
**Rating**: ⚠️ Partially Correct  
**Steps**: 5 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-01, CAN-02, CAN-10, CAN-11, CAN-14  
**Missing**: CAN-04 (NLU)

**Your Comments**:
- **Missing CAN-04**: "Isn't NLP CAN-04 is needed for all the prompts? It is powered by Copilot Reasoning and Language Understanding."
- Step 2 (CAN-02): "From this, I assume that the 'Meeting Classification' capability includes 'meeting type' and 'meeting importance'. Does 'important' equal to 'priority'?"
- Step 4 (CAN-11): "Does this overlap with 'Meeting Classification' (CAN-02)? It seems CAN-11 is about aligning with user goals but 'CAN-02' Meeting Classification also does similar things. If we have identify important vs. unimportant meetings via CAN-02, Meeting Classification, then why do we need this step?"

**Analysis**:
- **Missing CAN-04** is critical - NLU should be universal
- Reveals **overlap/confusion** between CAN-02 and CAN-11
- Need to clarify boundaries: Classification vs. Preference Matching

### Schedule Category (3 prompts)

#### schedule-1: "Land a weekly 30min 1:1 with Sarah for me..."
**Rating**: ⚠️ Partially Correct  
**Steps**: 7 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-05, CAN-06, CAN-03, CAN-12, CAN-15, CAN-16  
**Missing**: CAN-01 (Calendar Retrieval)

**Your Comments**:
- **Missing CAN-01**: "So CAN-01 is missing from this analysis."
- Step 3 (CAN-06): "Does this relate to CAN-01 Calendar Event Retrieval? This is the compliment of CAN-01 which is to find meetings. CAN-06 is to find free timeslots. Am I right? Do we need to do CAN-01 first? analysis on other prompts calls CAN-01 first."
- Step 4 (CAN-03): "Do we assume that we can always find a time to fulfill the request? If not, do we have a conflict resolution module to resolve the conflict?"

**Analysis**:
- **CAN-06 dependency on CAN-01** is implicit but should be explicit
- **Missing conflict resolution capability** - what if no time slots available?
- Need new task: **CAN-23: Conflict Resolution**

---

#### schedule-2: "Bump all my meetings that can move to later in the week..."
**Rating**: ✅ Correct  
**Steps**: 6 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-02, CAN-06, CAN-03, CAN-13

**Your Comments**:
- Step 3 (CAN-02): "So this time the Meeting Classification CAN-02 is used to classify 'reschedulable or not reschedulable'? Does this equal to 'important' or 'not important'? Looks like Meeting Classification include classify 'important' and 'reschedulable'."

**Analysis**:
- Clean execution flow
- Further evidence of **CAN-02 overloading**: now includes reschedulability classification
- CAN-02 is becoming a "catch-all" for any classification task

---

#### schedule-3: "I have a weekly team-sync on Tuesdays at 2pm. My 1:1s with my manager take priority..."
**Rating**: ✅ Correct  
**Steps**: 7 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-12, CAN-06, CAN-05, CAN-03, CAN-19

**Your Comments**:
- Step 4 (CAN-06): "Does CAN-06 depend on CAN-01?"

**Analysis**:
- Well-structured execution plan
- Confirms **CAN-06 ← CAN-01 dependency**
- First use of CAN-19 (Resource Booking) - correctly identified

---

### Collaborate Category (3 prompts)

#### collaborate-1: "Prep an agenda for my next meeting with the Project Alpha team..."
**Rating**: ⚠️ Partially Correct  
**Steps**: 5 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-05, CAN-08, CAN-09

**Your Comments**:
- Step 3 (CAN-05, CAN-08): "From CAN-05 and CAN-08, we can find who are working on Project Alpha and docs related to each member of the project team. However, **documents themselves do not tell us who is working on what. We need the capability to discover who works on what.**"
- Step 5 (CAN-09): "So this Document Generation capability include 'agenda generation'? Does this include all kinds of document generation? Do we need to specialize for various document generation, for example, PPT, spreadsheet, code, image, video, audio, plan, etc.?"

**Analysis**:
- **Missing work attribution capability** - critical gap
- Need new task: **CAN-22: Who Works On What Discovery**
- **CAN-09 scope unclear** - does it cover all document types or needs specialization?

#### collaborate-2: "Before my 1:1 with Jordan, pull together a briefing..."
**Rating**: ✅ Correct  
**Steps**: 5 (all correct)  
**Tasks Used**: CAN-04, CAN-01, CAN-02, CAN-08, CAN-09

**Your Comments**:
- Step 3 (CAN-02): "So in this case, the 'Meeting Classification' is to identify the meeting as '1:1'? So classification includes 'meeting type'?"

**Analysis**:
- Clean execution flow
- Confirms **CAN-02 includes meeting type classification**

---

## Key Issues Summary

### 1. CAN-02 Meeting Classification Conflation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Evidence** (mentioned in 4 prompts):
- organizer-1: "lump two types: meeting type and meeting priority"
- organizer-2: "includes both 'meeting type' and 'meeting importance'"
- organizer-3: "includes 'meeting type' and 'meeting importance'"
- schedule-2: "classify 'reschedulable or not reschedulable'"
- collaborate-2: "identify meeting as '1:1' (meeting type)"

**Problem**: CAN-02 is being used for multiple distinct classification tasks:
1. **Meeting Type** (format-based): 1:1, team meeting, customer meeting, all-hands
2. **Meeting Importance** (value-based): important vs. unimportant
3. **Meeting Priority** (ranking-based): high priority vs. low priority
4. **Meeting Reschedulability** (constraint-based): can move vs. cannot move

**Recommendation**: Split into separate tasks:
- **CAN-02A**: Meeting Type Classification (format-based)
- **CAN-02B**: Meeting Importance/Priority Assessment (value-based)

---

### 2. CAN-02 vs CAN-11 Overlap ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Your Question** (organizer-3):
> "Does CAN-11 overlap with CAN-02? If we have identify important vs. unimportant meetings via CAN-02, then why do we need this step?"

**Problem**: Unclear boundary between classification and preference matching

**Recommendation**: Clarify distinction:
- **CAN-02**: Objective classification based on meeting attributes
- **CAN-11**: Subjective matching against user-specific preferences and goals

---

### 3. Missing CAN-04 (NLU) in organizer-3 ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Your Finding**:
> "Isn't NLP CAN-04 is needed for all the prompts? It is powered by Copilot Reasoning and Language Understanding."

**Problem**: organizer-3 execution plan starts with CAN-01 (Calendar Retrieval) without CAN-04 (NLU)

**Recommendation**: Make CAN-04 universal - it should be Step 1 in ALL natural language prompts

---

### 4. CAN-06 Dependency on CAN-01 📊 MODERATE

**Your Questions**:
- schedule-1: "Does this relate to CAN-01? CAN-06 is to find free timeslots. Do we need to do CAN-01 first?"
- schedule-3: "Does CAN-06 depend on CAN-01?"

**Problem**: Dependency relationship not documented

**Recommendation**: Document that CAN-06 (Availability Checking) depends on CAN-01 (Calendar Retrieval)
- CAN-01 retrieves events (busy times)
- CAN-06 computes free/busy status from those events

---

### 5. Missing Capability: Task Duration Estimation 💡 NEW TASK NEEDED

**Your Finding** (organizer-2):
> "To answer this prompt, the system needs to have the capability of estimating the time for this individual to finish the preparation. This is not easy to estimate. But it needs to have some idea of how much time a person typically needs to reserve to finish a particular task."

**Recommendation**: Add new canonical task:
- **CAN-21**: Task Duration Estimation (Tier 2)
- Estimate time required for meeting preparation
- Learn from historical patterns and user behavior

---

### 6. Missing Capability: Who Works On What Discovery 💡 NEW TASK NEEDED

**Your Finding** (collaborate-1):
> "From CAN-05 and CAN-08, we can find who are working on Project Alpha and docs related to each member. However, **documents themselves do not tell us who is working on what. We need the capability to discover who works on what.**"

**Recommendation**: Add new canonical task:
- **CAN-22**: Work Attribution Discovery (Tier 2)
- Infer active contribution from documents, emails, calendar events
- Beyond simple "who has access" - discover actual work patterns

---

### 7. Missing Capability: Conflict Resolution 💡 NEW TASK NEEDED

**Your Question** (schedule-1):
> "Do we assume that we can always find a time to fulfill the request? If not, do we have a conflict resolution module to resolve the conflict?"

**Recommendation**: Add new canonical task:
- **CAN-23**: Conflict Resolution (Tier 3)
- Handle cases where constraints cannot be satisfied
- Negotiate trade-offs, suggest alternatives

---

### 8. Document Generation Scope Unclear 📋 CLARIFICATION NEEDED

**Your Question** (collaborate-1):
> "Does this Document Generation capability include 'agenda generation'? Does this include all kinds of document generation? Do we need to specialize for various document generation, for example, PPT, spreadsheet, code, image, video, audio, plan, etc.?"

**Recommendation**: Clarify CAN-09 scope:
- **Option A**: Single general task covering all document types
- **Option B**: Specialized sub-tasks for different formats (CAN-09A: Text, CAN-09B: Presentation, etc.)

---

## Recommended Actions

---

## Conclusion

Your evaluation revealed **critical framework issues** that, when addressed, will significantly improve the Canonical Unit Tasks library:

### What's Working:
- ✅ Tier 1 tasks (Universal) are well-defined and consistently used
- ✅ Execution flow logic is generally sound
- ✅ 67% of plans are fully correct
- ✅ No completely incorrect plans

### What Needs Fixing:
- ⚠️ CAN-02 conflation (multiple capabilities in one task)
- ⚠️ CAN-02 vs CAN-11 overlap/confusion
- ⚠️ CAN-04 not universal (missing from organizer-3)
- ⚠️ 20% of tasks never used (V1 vs V2 disconnect)
- ⚠️ 3 missing capabilities identified (duration, attribution, conflict resolution)

### Impact:
Your feedback transforms the framework from **initial hypothesis** to **validated, refined architecture** ready for implementation.
