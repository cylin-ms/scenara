EQUIVALENT (A = B)**  \n**C2 = G1:** Both represent the capability to **retrieve calendar events from the user’s calendar system**.  \n- C2: “Access and load pending calendar invitations and scheduled meetings requiring decisions”  \n- G1: “Access and fetch all scheduled calendar events from the user's calendar system”  \n**Common API:** Calendar event retrieval (read access).\n\n---\n\n### **2. SUBSET (A < B)**  \n**C4 < G5:**  \n- C4: “Determine which meetings to accept vs decline based on priority alignment thresholds and constraints”  \n- G5: “Separate events that do not match the user's priorities from those that do”  \n**Why subset?** C4 focuses on **decision logic for RSVP actions** (accept/decline), which is a narrower interpretation of filtering. G5 is broader because it includes classification and separation without necessarily deciding on RSVP actions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. SUPERSET (A > B)**  \n**C3 > G4:**  \n- C3: “Evaluate how well each meeting aligns with stated priorities using semantic matching and relevance scoring”  \n- G4: “Determine if each event aligns with the user's stated priorities”  \n**Why superset?** C3 implies **graded scoring and semantic relevance**, whereas G4 is a simpler binary classification (aligns or not). C3 encompasses G4’s functionality and adds more complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. OVERLAPPING (A ∩ B)**  \n**C5 ∩ G6:**  \n- C5: “Execute accept/decline actions on calendar system by updating RSVP status”  \n- G6: “Update the calendar to confirm attendance for meetings identified as priority”  \n**Shared part:** Both involve **writing back to the calendar system**.  \n**Unique parts:**  \n- C5 includes both **accept and decline actions**.  \n- G6 focuses only on **confirming attendance (accept)** for priority meetings, not handling declines.\n\n---\n\n### **5. CLAUDE UNIQUE (⊥)**  \n**C1:** “Priority Definition & Extraction”  \n- No GPT-5 equivalent. GPT-5 assumes priorities are already defined and just retrieves them (G3). C1 involves **deriving priorities from context/goals**, which is a distinct capability.  \n**C6:** “Decision Justification & Reporting”  \n- No GPT-5 equivalent. Explaining decisions and linking them to priority rules is unique to Claude’s decomposition.\n\n---\n\n### **6. GPT-5 UNIQUE (⊥)**  \n**G2:** “Extract Event Attributes”  \n- No Claude equivalent. Claude assumes event details are already available after retrieval. G2 explicitly parses and structures event attributes.  \n**G3:** “Retrieve User Priority Profile”  \n- No Claude equivalent.

SUBSET (C < G)**\n\n- **C2 < G2**: *Meeting Importance Classification* < *Identify Important Meetings*  \n  **Explanation:** C2 focuses on scoring meetings based on multiple criteria (importance classification), whereas G2 includes both detecting explicit importance markers and inferring importance. G2 is slightly broader because it may include user-defined flags or metadata beyond classification logic.\n\n- **C3 < G4**: *Preparation Time Estimation* < *Determine Preparation Requirement*  \n  **Explanation:** C3 only estimates the amount of prep time needed, while G4 decides whether a meeting requires any preparation at all (binary decision) based on context and importance. G4 may internally use time estimation, but its scope is broader.\n\n---\n\n### **3. SUPERSET (C > G)**\n\n- **C6 > G6**: *Focus Time Block Scheduling* > *Notify User of Preparation Needs*  \n  **Explanation:** C6 actively creates and schedules calendar blocks for preparation, which is a stronger action than G6’s notification. Scheduling implies user notification, but also involves calendar modification, making C6 a superset.\n\n---\n\n### **4. OVERLAPPING (C ∩ G)**\n\n- **C2 ∩ G3**: *Meeting Importance Classification* ∩ *Extract Meeting Context*  \n  **Shared part:** Both deal with meeting attributes.  \n  **Unique parts:** C2 uses attributes to classify importance; G3 focuses on extracting raw details (title, agenda, participants) without classification.\n\n- **C3 ∩ G4**: *Preparation Time Estimation* ∩ *Determine Preparation Requirement*  \n  **Shared part:** Both relate to preparation needs.  \n  **Unique parts:** C3 computes duration; G4 makes a yes/no decision based on multiple factors.\n\n- **C7 ∩ G6**: *Actionable Recommendations & Reporting* ∩ *Notify User of Preparation Needs*  \n  **Shared part:** Both communicate something to the user.  \n  **Unique parts:** C7 provides summaries, insights, and guidance; G6 only sends alerts/reminders.\n\n---\n\n### **5.

Meeting Context Retrieval**\n- **Capability:** Gather information about Project Alpha from available sources (docs, PM tools, status reports)\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- **G2. Identify Project Context**: Extract and confirm project name/context from prompt  \n  **C1 > G2**: C1 is broader because it involves gathering detailed project info from multiple sources, while G2 only extracts name/context from the prompt.\n- **Others (G1, G3–G8)**: No overlap (⊥)\n\n**Result:**  \n**C1 > G2**: C1 encompasses G2’s extraction and adds external data retrieval.\n\n---\n\n#### **C2. Stakeholder Role Identification**\n- **Capability:** Understand product vs marketing team roles, responsibilities, concerns\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- **G3. Determine Participants**: Identify required participants (product and marketing team)  \n  **C2 > G3**: C2 goes beyond identifying participants; it understands their roles and concerns.\n- **G4. Retrieve Team Member Details**: Map teams to actual contacts  \n  **C2 ∩ G4**: Overlap in understanding who is involved, but G4 focuses on mapping to actual contacts, while C2 focuses on conceptual roles/responsibilities.\n\n**Result:**  \n**C2 > G3**  \n**C2 ∩ G4**\n\n---\n\n#### **C3. Agenda Structure Planning**\n- **Capability:** Create logical flow for review meeting (progress → confirmation → blockers → risks)\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- **G5. Define Agenda Objectives**: Extract and structure meeting objectives  \n  **C3 ∩ G5**: Both involve structuring, but G5 focuses on extracting objectives from prompt, while C3 focuses on designing the flow/order.\n- **G6. Generate Agenda Items**: Convert objectives into actionable items in logical order  \n  **C3 ∩ G6**: Overlap in ordering/logical flow, but G6 is about generating items, while C3 is about high-level structure.\n\n**Result:**  \n**C3 ∩ G5**  \n**C3 ∩ G6**\n\n---\n\n#### **C4. Progress Review Items Generation**\n- **Capability:** List specific accomplishments, milestones, metrics to review\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- **G6. Generate Agenda Items**: Convert objectives into actionable agenda items  \n  **C4 < G6**: C4 is narrower because it only covers progress review items, while G6 covers all agenda items.\n\n**Result:**  \n**C4 < G6**\n\n---\n\n#### **C5. Blocker & Risk Identification**\n- **Capability:** Surface known issues, dependencies, blockers, risks\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- **G6. Generate Agenda Items**: Convert objectives into actionable items  \n  **C5 < G6**: C5 is narrower because it only covers blockers/risks, while G6 covers all agenda items.\n\n**Result:**  \n**C5 < G6**\n\n---\n\n#### **C6. Time Allocation & Formatting**\n- **Capability:** Assign time to each agenda item and format for professional distribution\n\nCompare to GPT-5:\n- No GPT-5 task mentions time allocation or formatting.  \n**C6 ⊥ all G#**\n\n**Result:**  \n**C6 is unique.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify GPT-5 Unique Tasks**\n\nCheck GPT-5 tasks not covered by any Claude task:\n- **G1. Extract Meeting Intent**: Identify that user wants to create an agenda  \n  ⊥ all C#: Claude assumes intent, doesn’t extract it explicitly → **Unique**\n- **G7. Validate Agenda Completeness**: Check all topics included  \n  ⊥ all C#: Claude doesn’t validate completeness → **Unique**\n- **G8. Present Agenda for Confirmation**: Display agenda for approval  \n  ⊥ all C#: Claude doesn’t include user confirmation → **Unique**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **FINAL OUTPUT**\n\n---\n\n### **EQUIVALENT (A = B)**\n*(None found — no exact matches)*\n\n---\n\n### **SUBSET (A < B)**\n- **C4 < G6**: C4 only generates progress review items, while G6 generates all agenda items.\n- **C5 < G6**: C5 only identifies blockers/risks, while G6 generates all agenda items.\n\n---\n\n### **SUPERSET (A > B)**\n- **C1 > G2**: C1 gathers detailed project info from multiple sources, while G2 only extracts project name/context from prompt.\n- **C2 > G3**: C2 understands roles/responsibilities, while G3 only identifies participants.\n\n---\n\n### **OVERLAPPING (A ∩ B)**\n- **C2 ∩ G4**: Both deal with participants; C2 focuses on roles/responsibilities, G4 on mapping to contacts.\n- **C3 ∩ G5**: Both involve structuring; C3 focuses on flow, G5 on extracting objectives.\n- **C3 ∩ G6**: Both involve ordering; C3 focuses on structure, G6 on generating items.\n\n---\n\n### **CLAUDE UNIQUE**\n- **C6**: Time allocation and professional formatting of agenda.\n\n---\n\n### **GPT-5 UNIQUE**\n- **G1**: Extract meeting intent from user prompt.\n- **G7**: Validate agenda completeness.\n- **G8**: Present agenda for user confirmation.\n\n---\n\n✅ This analysis shows **Claude focuses more on content depth and meeting context**, while **GPT-5 emphasizes intent extraction, validation, and user interaction steps**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **visualize this as a relationship matrix (Claude vs GPT-5)** for quick reference?

Same atomic function: retrieval of meeting materials.\n\n- **C5 = G5**: *Objection Anticipation* = *Generate Potential Objections*  \n  **Common capability:** Both predict likely objections or concerns from senior leadership. Identical predictive capability.\n\n- **C6 = G6**: *Response Preparation* = *Create Effective Responses*  \n  **Common capability:** Both formulate persuasive responses to anticipated objections. Same atomic function.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

G4 is broader: it involves prioritizing and selecting top three topics from a candidate list, which includes ranking logic beyond summarization. C3 is narrower because it assumes the summarization step and fixed output, while G4 includes prioritization criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **3. SUPERSET (C > G)**\n\n- **C2 > G2**: *Content Analysis & Topic Extraction* > *Analyze Meeting Materials*  \n  **Explanation:** G2 focuses on reading and extracting key information and themes.

So they overlap on topic identification but differ in scope and output format.\n\n- **C3 ∩ G3**: *Executive Summary Distillation* ∩ *Generate Candidate Discussion Topics*  \n  **Shared part:** Both relate to discussion topics.  \n  **Unique parts:** C3 condenses into **three final points**, while G3 just lists all possible topics without prioritization. Overlap is minimal but present in the sense that both operate on the same conceptual space (topics).\n\n---\n\n### **5.
