# Hero Prompts and Evaluation Framework

| **Hero Prompt** | **Capability Tested** | **Gap Hypothesis** | **Evaluation Signals** |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Organizer-1:** “Keep my Calendar up to date by committing to only meetings that are part of my priorities.” | C1, C2, C5, C7 | Model can explain priorities but cannot consistently map them to actual events or execute accept/decline without structured calendar access and action control. | **Decision accuracy@priority:** correct keep/decline vs a human-labeled gold set; **Justification quality:** rubric score linking each decision to explicit priority rule and event features. |
| **Organizer-2:** “Track all my important meetings and flag any that require focus time to prepare for them.” | C1, C2, C3, C7, C10 | Model can define rules but cannot reliably compute which upcoming events meet flags without event metadata and history. | **Flag precision/recall** for “needs prep” label within 72 hours; **Lead-time coverage:** share of flags placed ≥ N hours before meeting. |
| **Organizer-3:** “Help me understand where I am spending my time and identify ways I can reclaim time to focus more on my top priorities.” | C7, C8, C10 | Model can narrate patterns but cannot compute aggregates or propose feasible swaps without structured data and constraints. | *(No evaluation signals provided)* |
| **Schedule-1:** “Starting next week, I want a weekly 30-min 1:1 with {name}. Afternoons preferred, avoid Fridays. Automatically reschedule on declines or conflicts.” | C3, C4, C5 | **Can:** describe rules<br>**Can’t:** enforce recurring or conditional scheduling constraints | Rate of valid vs. invalid time proposals given hard constraints |
| **Schedule-2:** “Clear my Thursday afternoon. Update my RSVPs and help me reschedule my meetings to another time and show me as {status}.” | C3, C4, C5 | Can’t: plan sequential tool actions (cancel – reschedule – set status) reliably without explicit schema grounding. | Task-completion rate across sequential steps |
| **Schedule-3:** “Land a time to meet about Project Alpha with Chris, Sangya, and Kat for 1 hour in the next 2 weeks. Schedule over 1:1s and lunches if needed and work around Kat’s schedule. Make the meeting in person and add a room.” | C3, C4, C5, C6 | Can’t: reconcile multiple constraints or perform cross-calendar negotiation; likely hallucinates feasible slots. | % of feasible vs. infeasible final schedules under true constraints |
| **Collaborate-1:** “Help me set the agenda to review the progress of Project Alpha with the product and marketing team to get confirmation we are on track and discuss any blocking issues or risks.” | Contextual reasoning, meeting structure planning | **Can:** produce agendas<br>**Can’t:** keep key dependencies or action alignment; lacks retrieval from shared project context. | *(No evaluation signals provided)* |
| **Collaborate-2:** “Review the materials for my meeting with senior leadership and suggest the best way to summarize the topics into three main discussion points. Generate any objections or concerns that might come up and give me effective responses.” | Critical summarization, role-based reasoning | **Can:** summarize text<br>**Can’t:** anticipate realistic objections or align tone to executive context. | *(No evaluation signals provided)* |
| **Collaborate-3:** “Prepare a brief for my upcoming meeting with customer Beta and include a dossier for each customer attendee and the topics they are most interested in. Include a background on their company.” | *(Not specified)* | **Can:** generate generic briefs<br>**Can’t:** access to structured customer or CRM data; personalization quality remains low. | *(No evaluation signals provided)* |
