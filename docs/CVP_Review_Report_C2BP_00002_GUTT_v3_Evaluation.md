## Trigger Precision Analysis

### **Expected vs. Triggered Tasks**
```yaml
Expected_Tasks: [GUTT.02, GUTT.03, GUTT.07, GUTT.13, GUTT.20]
Triggered_Tasks: [GUTT.02, GUTT.03, GUTT.07, GUTT.13]
Missing_Tasks: [GUTT.20 - Summarize meeting objectives into specific goals]

GUTT_Trigger_Precision: 4/4 = 100% (No false triggers)
GUTT_Trigger_Recall: 4/5 = 80% (One expected task not triggered)
GUTT_Trigger_F1: 2 Ã— (1.0 Ã— 0.8) / (1.0 + 0.8) = 89%
```

### **Missing Task Impact Analysis**
**GUTT.20: Summarize [meeting objectives] into [specific goals]** (Not Triggered)
**Expected Slot Values**: [meeting objectives] = "1-1 discussion topics", [specific goals] = "concrete outcomes to achieve by end of meeting"

Impact Analysis: While the system provided goal-oriented content, it could have been enhanced with more explicit goal statement formatting. The system delivered strategic themes and action areas but didn't format them as specific, measurable objectives. Impact: Minor - core user needs still well-addressed through other triggered tasks.
