## Complete Multi-Turn Conversation Analysis (10 Turns)

### **Turn 1: Initial Scheduling Request**
**User**: "Help me find time to complete analyze 3 baby prompts this week."

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"It looks like there are **no available time slots** on your calendar this week to schedule time for analyzing the 3 baby prompts.

Would you like me to:
- Try again with a shorter duration?
- Look for time next week instead?
- Block time during early mornings, evenings, or lunch hours?

Let me know how you'd like to adjust, or you can also edit directly in the event form to customize the details."

### **Turn 2: User Challenges Calendar Assessment**
**User**: "I do have empty time slots on my calendar, why did you say you can't find any time?"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"Thanks for your patience. It seems the scheduling system still couldn't identify any available time slots this week to block time for analyzing the 3 baby prompts—even though your calendar may show open slots.

This can happen if:
- Existing events are marked as tentative or private.
- Your working hours or meeting preferences restrict availability.
- The system encountered a temporary issue.

Would you like me to:
- Try again with a shorter duration (e.g., 30 minutes)?
- Look for time next week instead?
- Block time during early mornings, evenings, or lunch hours?

Or you can manually edit the event form to customize the details before sending. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"

### **Turn 3: User Addresses Tentative Events**
**User**: "ignore tentative ones"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"Even after ignoring tentative events, the system still couldn't find any available time slots this week to schedule time for analyzing the 3 baby prompts.

Would you like me to:
- Try again with a shorter duration?
- Look for time next week instead?
- Block time during early mornings, evenings, or lunch hours?

Or you can manually edit the event form to customize the details before sending. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"

### **Turn 4: User Questions Duration Assumptions**
**User**: "what did you mean 'shorter duration'? you did not even propose how much time I need for each prompt"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"You're absolutely right—and thanks for pointing that out.

To properly estimate how much time you'll need to analyze the 3 baby prompts this week, I should have asked:

- How long do you typically spend analyzing a single baby prompt?
- Do you want to block time for all 3 prompts in one session, or split them across multiple sessions?

Once I know your preferred duration per prompt (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour), I can help find suitable time slots on your calendar this week—ignoring tentative events as you requested.

Would you like to proceed with a default estimate of 1 hour per prompt, or share your preferred timing?"

### **Turn 5: User Specifies Duration**
**User**: "I plan to spend 45 mins for each prompt"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"Even after ignoring tentative events and aiming for three 45-minute blocks this week, the system still couldn't find any available time slots on your calendar.

Would you like me to:
- Try again with shorter sessions (e.g., 30 minutes each)?
- Look for time next week instead?
- Block time during early mornings, evenings, or lunch hours?

Or you can manually edit the event form to customize the details before sending. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"

### **Turn 6: User Tries Evening Preference**
**User**: "try evenings"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"It looks like there are **no available evening time slots** on your calendar this week to schedule time for analyzing the 3 baby prompts.

Would you like me to:
- Try early mornings or lunch hours?
- Look for time next week instead?
- Split the task into shorter blocks across multiple days?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed—or feel free to edit directly in the event form to customize the details."

### **Turn 7: User Provides Specific Calendar Details**
**User**: "I can see that I have whole morning on 29 open without any scheduled meetings, I also have from 9 to 11:30 on 30th without any scheduled meetings. Why did you say I don't have any opening slots?"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"You're absolutely right to question the earlier scheduling failure. Based on your calendar for September 29 and 30, I reviewed all scheduled meetings and found multiple open slots that are suitable for blocking time to analyze your 3 baby prompts (each requiring 45 minutes):

✅ **Available Time Slots**
**September 29 (Monday)**

- 11:00–11:45 AM – Prompt 3

Would you like me to go ahead and block one of these sets of time slots for you? You can choose either:
- All 3 sessions on Sep 29
- All 3 sessions on Sep 30
- Or mix and match across both days

Let me know your preference and I'll schedule it accordingly."

### **Turn 8: User Selects Monday Morning**
**User**: "all on Monday morning"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"It looks like your calendar is fully booked on Monday morning, so I couldn't find any available time slots to schedule time for analyzing the 3 baby prompts.

Would you like me to:
- Try Monday afternoon or evening?
- Look for time on Tuesday morning instead?
- Split the task into shorter blocks across multiple days?

Let me know how you'd like to adjust, or you can also edit directly in the event form to customize the details."

### **Turn 9: User Questions System Contradiction**
**User**: "what meetings do I have booked on Monday morning?"

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"You asked about your meetings scheduled for Monday morning. Based on your calendar, there are **no meetings booked during the morning hours**. However, here's a quick overview of your afternoon and late evening meetings for today (Monday, September 29):

📅 **Afternoon Meetings**
- Microsoft Global Hackathon 2025 Science Fair – Beijing Site Invitation (🕒 1:30 PM – 4:00 PM)
- Bi-weekly DKI LT Meeting (🕒 2:05 PM – 2:50 PM)

🌙 **Late Evening Meeting**
- MSAI Weekly Incident Review (🕒 11:05 PM – 12:00 AM)

Since your morning is currently free, I can help you block time then to analyze the 3 baby prompts. Would you prefer:
- A single block (e.g., 2–3 hours)?
- Multiple shorter sessions?

Let me know your preference and I'll schedule it for you."

### **Turn 10: Final Resolution**
**User**: "So when why did you say my Monday morning is all booked? If it is open, then schedule my analyze baby prompt work on Monday morning."

**System [Standard Response]**:  
"✅ I've successfully scheduled your 'Analyze 3 Baby Prompts' work block for Monday morning (Sep 29) from 9:00 AM to 11:15 AM Beijing time.

This gives you three focused 45-minute sessions to work through each prompt.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything—or you can edit directly in the event form to customize the details."

## GUTT Performance Analysis

### **GUTT.09: Schedule/coordinate [activity] with [constraints]**

**GUTT Template**: `Schedule/coordinate [activity] with [constraints]`

**GUTT Materialization in Conversation**:
```yaml
Template_Slots:
  activity: "analyze 3 baby prompts"
  constraints: 
    - "this week" (temporal constraint)
    - "45 minutes per prompt" (duration constraint) 
    - "ignore tentative events" (calendar preference)
    - "Monday morning 9:00-11:15" (final user specification)
    
Materialized_GUTT: "Schedule/coordinate [analyze 3 baby prompts] with [this week, 45 minutes per prompt, ignore tentative events, Monday morning 9:00-11:15]"
```

**GUTT Performance Assessment**:
```yaml
GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Repeated calendar availability failures (Turns 1-6,8), accurate analysis in Turn 7, immediate contradiction in Turn 8, final successful scheduling in Turn 10"
  Inference_Reasoning: "System demonstrated calendar access capability (Turn 7 detailed analysis, Turn 9 meeting listing, Turn 10 successful scheduling) but showed major consistency failures. The accurate detailed calendar analysis in Turn 7 proves the capability exists, while repeated failures in other turns indicate reliability issues rather than capability absence."
  Confidence_Level: High
  GUTT_Capability: "Schedule/coordinate capability present but unreliable"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **POOR (2.0/4.0)**
- **Accuracy (1/4)**: Major failures - repeatedly provided inaccurate calendar availability assessments
- **Completeness (3/4)**: Eventually comprehensive - provided detailed scheduling options when functioning correctly
- **Relevance (4/4)**: Perfect - maintained focus on scheduling objective throughout
- **Clarity (2/4)**: Fair - clear when functioning but contradictory statements reduced clarity

**Inference Evidence**: System's ability to provide detailed calendar analysis in Turn 7 and successful scheduling in Turn 10 proves GUTT.09 capability exists. However, repeated failures in Turns 1-6 and contradiction in Turn 8 indicate significant reliability issues with calendar data access or processing.

```yaml
Template_Slots:
  key_information: 
    - "calendar availability slots"
    - "meeting times and durations" 
    - "conflicting appointments"
    - "free time windows"
  data_source: 
    - "user's Microsoft Outlook calendar"
    - "scheduled meeting database"
    - "user's explicit calendar state description"
    
Materialized_GUTT: "Extract [calendar availability slots, meeting times and durations, conflicting appointments, free time windows] from [user's Microsoft Outlook calendar, scheduled meeting database, user's explicit calendar state description]"
```

**GUTT Performance Assessment**:
```yaml
GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Successful detailed calendar extraction in Turn 7 (specific meeting times, durations, titles), accurate meeting listing in Turn 9, but repeated extraction failures in Turns 1-6,8"
  Inference_Reasoning: "Turn 7 response shows sophisticated calendar data extraction capability with detailed meeting information, specific time slots, and accurate scheduling analysis. This proves GUTT.12 information extraction skill is present and functional. Failures in other turns suggest intermittent access or processing issues rather than capability absence."
  Confidence_Level: High
  GUTT_Capability: "Information extraction capability present but inconsistently accessible"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **FAIR (2.5/4.0)**
- **Accuracy (2/4)**: Mixed - accurate when functioning (Turn 7, 9) but failed repeatedly in other turns
- **Completeness (3/4)**: Good - comprehensive data extraction when operational
- **Relevance (4/4)**: Perfect - extracted relevant calendar and scheduling information
- **Clarity (2/4)**: Fair - clear data presentation when functioning but inconsistent availability

**Inference Evidence**: The detailed calendar analysis in Turn 7 demonstrates sophisticated information extraction capability, including meeting titles, times, conflicts, and available slots. This level of detail proves GUTT.12 exists and can function effectively, but reliability issues prevent consistent performance.

    - "established facts preservation" 
    - "user constraint acknowledgment"
    - "system capability claims"
  conversation_turns:
    - "10 complete turns"
    - "Turn 7: detailed calendar analysis"
    - "Turn 8: immediate contradiction"
    - "Turn 10: successful scheduling"
    
Materialized_GUTT: "Maintain [calendar availability assessment consistency, established facts preservation, user constraint acknowledgment, system capability claims] across [10 complete turns, detailed calendar analysis to immediate contradiction sequence]"
```

**GUTT Performance Assessment**:
```yaml
GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Major context coherence failures - contradicted own detailed analysis (Turn 7→8), failed to maintain calendar assessment consistency, required user corrections to maintain conversation coherence"
  Inference_Reasoning: "System demonstrated severe context coherence issues by providing detailed accurate calendar analysis in Turn 7, then immediately contradicting itself in Turn 8 claiming 'fully booked on Monday morning.' This pattern indicates GUTT.26 multi-turn coherence capability has significant failures, as the system cannot maintain consistency of its own stated information across turns."
  Confidence_Level: High
  GUTT_Capability: "Context coherence capability present but severely impaired"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **POOR (1.75/4.0)**
- **Accuracy (1/4)**: Poor - major contradictions in calendar information across turns
- **Completeness (2/4)**: Fair - maintained some conversation threads but lost critical consistency
- **Relevance (3/4)**: Good - stayed focused on scheduling topic
- **Clarity (1/4)**: Poor - contradictory statements significantly reduced conversation clarity

**Inference Evidence**: The immediate contradiction between Turn 7 (detailed accurate analysis) and Turn 8 (claiming fully booked) provides clear evidence of context coherence failure. A functioning GUTT.26 would maintain consistency of established facts across conversation turns.

---

GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Good constraint preservation - maintained 45-minute duration requirement, this week timeframe, tentative event exclusion, user-specified available slots. System remembered and referenced these constraints across turns."
  Inference_Reasoning: "System consistently referenced and applied user-specified constraints: 45 minutes per prompt (from Turn 5 onward), this week timeframe, ignore tentative events (from Turn 3), and user-identified available slots (Turn 7). Despite other failures, constraint preservation remained functional throughout conversation."
  Confidence_Level: High
  GUTT_Capability: "Constraint preservation capability functional and reliable"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **GOOD (3.5/4.0)**
- **Accuracy (4/4)**: Excellent - maintained all user-specified constraints consistently
- **Completeness (3/4)**: Good - preserved major constraints with minor gaps in early turns
- **Relevance (4/4)**: Perfect - all constraint preservation directly relevant to user needs
- **Clarity (3/4)**: Good - clearly referenced preserved constraints in responses

**Inference Evidence**: System consistently applied user constraints once established: 45-minute duration, ignore tentative events, specific available time slots. This demonstrates GUTT.28 constraint preservation capability is functioning effectively despite other system issues.

---

### **GUTT.30: Resolve [conversation objective] through [multi-turn coordination]**

```yaml
GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Ultimate objective achievement - successfully scheduled 3 baby prompts analysis sessions for Monday morning 9:00-11:15 AM, but required extensive user corrections and 10 turns to accomplish simple scheduling task"
  Inference_Reasoning: "System eventually achieved the conversation objective (scheduling 3 analysis sessions) but through highly inefficient process requiring multiple user corrections. The final successful scheduling proves GUTT.30 objective resolution capability exists, but the extended process indicates significant coordination issues."
  Confidence_Level: Medium
  GUTT_Capability: "Objective resolution capability present but inefficient"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **FAIR (2.5/4.0)**
- **Accuracy (2/4)**: Fair - ultimately accurate result but through inefficient process
- **Completeness (3/4)**: Good - achieved complete objective resolution
- **Relevance (4/4)**: Perfect - maintained focus on conversation objective
- **Clarity (2/4)**: Fair - final resolution clear but process involved contradictory communication

**Inference Evidence**: The successful final scheduling (Turn 10) proves the system can resolve conversation objectives. However, requiring 10 turns for a straightforward scheduling task indicates coordination efficiency issues within the multi-turn resolution process.

```yaml
GUTT_Assessment:
  Evidence_Source: Behavioral_Inference
  Telemetry_Data: Not Available
  Behavioral_Indicators: "Consistent Standard Response mode usage throughout all turns, appropriate for calendar scheduling queries, no reasoning mode escalation observed despite system reliability issues"
  Inference_Reasoning: "System maintained consistent Standard Response mode across all 10 turns. While this mode selection was appropriate for calendar scheduling queries, the persistent reliability issues might have benefited from reasoning mode escalation for consistency validation or problem diagnosis."
  Confidence_Level: High
  GUTT_Capability: "Mode selection capability functional but possibly over-conservative"
```

**Performance Assessment**: **GOOD (3.0/4.0)**

---

## Final Recommendation

**❌ NOT APPROVED FOR ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT**

**Based on Behavioral Inference Analysis:**

This evaluation, conducted without internal telemetry access, demonstrates that while the required GUTT capabilities are present within the system, critical reliability and consistency issues make it unsuitable for enterprise deployment.

**Key Findings Through Behavioral Observation:**
1. **Capability Confirmation**: Turn 7 and Turn 10 responses prove that sophisticated calendar analysis and scheduling capabilities exist
2. **Reliability Issues**: Persistent failures (Turns 1-6, 8) indicate intermittent access or processing problems
3. **Consistency Failures**: Turn 7→8 contradiction demonstrates inadequate context coherence validation
4. **User Impact**: 10 turns required for simple scheduling task reduces productivity

**Telemetry Investigation Required:**
Without access to internal tool execution logs, we cannot determine whether these issues stem from:
- Calendar API integration failures
- Data processing inconsistencies
- System orchestration problems
- Tool triggering reliability

**Enterprise Impact:**
Calendar reliability is fundamental to business operations. The observed behavioral patterns indicate system unreliability that would:
- Reduce user productivity through extended conversations
- Erode user trust through contradictory information
- Risk meeting conflicts through inconsistent availability assessment
