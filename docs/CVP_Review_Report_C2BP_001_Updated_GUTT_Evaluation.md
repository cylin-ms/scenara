   - **Query**: `"<Event>Bi-weekly 1:1 Chin-Yew | Dongmei</Event> upcoming agenda objectives goals notes"`
   - **Search Domain**: "meetings" with "prep" intent filter
   - **Results**: Meeting metadata, emails, and related documents retrieved

2. **Partial Response Generation**:
   - **Output Generated** (Line 5670): `"**Planning meeting goals**I am preparing to fetch the event details for the \"Bi-weekly 1:1 Chin-Yew | Dongmei\" to gather the meeting's objectives and desired outcomes."`
   - **Progress Indication**: System demonstrates awareness and active processing

3. **Enhanced Context Processing**:
   - **File Processing**: 5,713 lines (+1,748 lines, +44% expansion)
   - **Model Utilization Data**: New UtilizationClient results show resource allocation
   - **Pipeline Extensions**: Additional processing groups through ExtensionRunnerGroup:2950000

### **System Response Status Evolution**
- **Previous Status**: ❌ No response generation (Complete system failure)
- **Updated Status**: ⚠️ Partial response generation (System functional but incomplete)
- **Critical Finding**: System now recognizes task, initiates search, and provides preliminary response

## Comparative GUTT Framework Evaluation

### **Enhanced Unit Task Performance Analysis**

#### **GUTT.17: Find content of [artifact] for [event]** - **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**
**Previous Performance**: ❌ Critical Failure (0/4 points)  
**Updated Performance**: ✅ Substantial Success (3/4 points)

**Enhancement Evidence:**
- **Search Activation**: `search_enterprise_meetings` successfully called with contextual query
- **Data Retrieval**: Meeting metadata, related emails, and documents found
- **Search Results**: Meeting scheduled for 2025-09-29, related communications identified
- **Remaining Gap**: Data not fully synthesized into final user response

#### **GUTT.14: Identify [project/team/person] from context** - **MAINTAINED EXCELLENCE** 
**Previous Performance**: ✅ Success (4/4 points)  
**Updated Performance**: ✅ Success (4/4 points)
- No degradation in stakeholder identification capability
- Enhanced user context processing maintained

#### **GUTT.20: Summarize [meeting objectives] into [specific goals]** - **PARTIAL IMPROVEMENT**
**Previous Performance**: ❌ Critical Failure (0/4 points)  
**Updated Performance**: ⚠️ Partial Success (2/4 points)

**Enhancement Evidence:**
- **Goal Recognition**: Response shows awareness of "meeting goals" objective  
- **Process Initiation**: "preparing to fetch event details" indicates systematic approach
- **Partial Synthesis**: Beginning of goal-oriented response structure
- **Remaining Gap**: Complete goal extraction and specific objectives not delivered

## Updated Category Scoring

### **Category 1: Task Trigger Analysis**
- **Should be Triggered**: 3 tasks
- **Correctly Triggered**: 2.5 tasks (GUTT.17 now partially triggered)
- **Enhanced Trigger Recall**: 83.3% (vs. 66.7% previously)
- **Trigger Precision**: 83.3% (improvement in execution quality)

### **Category 2: Generative Output Quality Enhancement**
- **GUTT.17 Quality**: 3/4 (Major improvement from 0/4)
- **GUTT.14 Quality**: 4/4 (Maintained excellence)
- **GUTT.20 Quality**: 2/4 (Improvement from 0/4)
- **Average Quality**: 3.0/4 = 75.0% (vs. 50.0% previously)

## Final GUTT-Enterprise Score Calculation

### **Updated Performance Metrics**
- **Task Triggering**: 83.3% (16.6 point improvement)
- **Generative Quality**: 75.0% (25.0 point improvement)
- **Weighted Score**: (83.3% × 0.4) + (75.0% × 0.6) = **78.3%**

### **Overall GUTT Score: 73.3% (Performance Warning)**
*Previous Score: 56.7% (Critical Failure)*  
**Net Improvement: +16.6 percentage points**
