2. **Calculate GUTT score**: Average of 4 factors
3. **Apply meeting type context** for interpretation
4. **Document evidence** for each factor score
5. **Provide improvement recommendations** based on lowest-scoring factors

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Calibration**: Use examples to ensure consistent scoring
- **Evidence**: Require specific examples for each factor score
- **Context**: Adjust expectations based on meeting complexity
- **Bias**: Maintain objectivity across different systems and vendors
