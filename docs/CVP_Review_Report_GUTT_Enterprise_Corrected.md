## Executive Summary

This evaluation analyzes the system's response to a meeting goal extraction request using the official GUTT-Enterprise framework. The system demonstrates a methodical approach to understanding meeting objectives through structured event analysis and enterprise context integration, though the response remains at an intermediate processing stage rather than providing direct goal extraction.

### **Overall Prompt Assessment: 2.33/3.0 (77.8% effectiveness)**

The system shows strong enterprise context awareness and systematic processing approach, but needs improvement in providing complete, actionable responses to goal extraction queries.
