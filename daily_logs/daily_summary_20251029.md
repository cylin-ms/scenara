## 🤔 Decisions & Lessons

### 📋 Key Decisions

- **Redesigned validation interface from dual-model comparison to single-model focus** 🟠
  - *Reasoning*: Dual-model comparison added complexity without value since we validate one model at a time. Single-model UI is cleaner, faster, and maintains separate validation files per model.
