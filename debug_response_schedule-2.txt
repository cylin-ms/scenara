  "solvability": {
    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The task involves multiple sub-steps: (1) interpreting 'Thursday afternoon' in the user's timezone, (2) identifying all events in that window, (3) clearing them (cancel or reschedule), (4) updating RSVPs, (5) finding alternative times for rescheduling, and (6) setting the user's status. Current AI can handle natural language interpretation and API calls, but rescheduling requires negotiation logic, availability checks, and preference handling, which are non-trivial. APIs like Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph support these operations, but orchestrating them reliably with user-specific constraints is complex.",
    "difficulty_factors": [
      "Ambiguity in 'afternoon' definition and time zone handling",
      "Dependency on external calendar APIs and permissions",
      "Rescheduling requires finding mutually available slots",
      "User-specific preferences and organizational norms",
      "Potential conflicts with recurring events or external attendees"
    ]
  },
  "verification_ease": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Verification is straightforward because the calendar state can be checked against the intended outcome: Thursday afternoon should be free, RSVPs updated, meetings rescheduled, and status set. These are objective conditions that can be programmatically validated via API queries.",
    "verification_methods": [
      "Query calendar API to confirm Thursday afternoon is empty",
      "Check event metadata for updated RSVPs",
      "Verify new meeting times exist and match constraints",
      "Confirm user status field reflects requested value"
    ]
  },
  "verification_asymmetry": {
    "score": 9 - (10 - 6) = 5,
    "interpretation": "Positive asymmetry: The task is significantly easier to verify than to solve. This means it's a strong candidate for AI automation under Verifier's Law.",

  "training_data_quality": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Synthetic data can be generated by simulating calendar states and user intents. Real-world logs (with privacy safeguards) can provide high-quality examples. Verification is easy, so reinforcement learning from outcome-based feedback is feasible.",

  "key_insights": [
    "High verification asymmetry makes this task ideal for iterative AI improvement",
    "Complexity lies in multi-step orchestration and preference handling, not in verification",

    "Rescheduling logic is the hardest sub-problem due to multi-party constraints"
  ],
  "recommendation": "HIGH priority for AI development. Focus on building a pipeline that decomposes the task into verifiable sub-steps (clear events, update RSVPs, reschedule). Use verification signals for RL fine-tuning. Start with single-user scenarios, then expand to multi-attendee negotiation."
