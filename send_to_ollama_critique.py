    EXPERT ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:

    STRENGTHS:
    ‚úÖ Evidence-based approach eliminates false positives effectively
    ‚úÖ Multi-dimensional scoring considers various collaboration signals
    ‚úÖ System account filtering prevents automated noise
    ‚úÖ User feedback integration demonstrates iterative improvement
    ‚úÖ Clear transparency in scoring rationale

    WEAKNESSES & RECOMMENDATIONS:

    1. SCORING WEIGHTS OPTIMIZATION:
    - Current weights (1:1=20, organized=15) may need calibration
    - Recommend A/B testing different weight combinations
    - Consider machine learning to optimize weights based on user validation

    2. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS GAPS:
    - Missing recency weighting (recent collaboration vs old)
    - No decay function for aging relationships
    - Recommendation: Add time-based scoring decay

    3. CONTEXT AWARENESS:
    - Algorithm doesn't consider meeting context/importance
    - All meetings weighted equally regardless of purpose
    - Recommendation: Add meeting importance classification

    4. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
    - Limited sample size for validation
    - No cross-validation with other users
    - Recommendation: Implement statistical significance testing

    5. ENTERPRISE SCALABILITY:
    - O(n¬≤) complexity for large organizations
    - No distributed processing consideration
    - Recommendation: Implement graph-based algorithms for efficiency

    IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Add temporal decay function
    - Implement meeting context classification
    - Create statistical validation framework
    - Optimize for enterprise-scale processing

    FUTURE EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
    1. Temporal analysis enhancement (immediate)
    2. Context-aware meeting classification
    3. Statistical validation framework
    4. Machine learning weight optimization
    5. Graph-based organizational analysis
