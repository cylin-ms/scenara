The plan should start from the meeting date (2025\u201112\u201104) and work backwards to today (T\u201130), outlining all tasks, owners, dependencies, durations, and milestones needed to prepare the presentation, validate data, secure approvals, and deliver the listed outputs on time. Include risk mitigation steps for data latency, engineering capacity, and compliance constraints.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
