  "workback_prompt": "Create a detailed workback plan for the Apex BioPharma \u2013 NeuroGenix Therapeutics integration scenario described above. The plan should cover all workstreams (HR, IT, Finance, Product Development, Sales & Marketing, Operations & Manufacturing, Regulatory Affairs, Legal & Compliance, Change Management, PMO), list day\u20111 priorities, outline 30\u201160\u201190\u2011day milestones, allocate resources (15\u201130 integration team members), identify risks and mitigation actions, define communication cadence (town\u2011halls, newsletters, intranet updates), and include metrics to track progress toward the $120M cost\u2011synergy and $200M revenue\u2011synergy targets.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
