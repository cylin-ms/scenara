Include all major milestones: beta program (T\u201160), release candidate freeze (T\u201130), compliance audit sign\u2011off (T\u201125), pricing approval (T\u201120), partner certification (T\u201115), launch event preparation (T\u20115), and post\u2011launch monitoring (T\u202f+\u202f90). Map each deliverable, assign owners from the stakeholder list, specify required resources, dependencies, critical path tasks, risk mitigation, and success\u2011criteria tracking. Provide a week\u2011by\u2011week timeline, key decision gates, and a budget\u2011tracking summary that respects the $5\u202fM cap and the listed constraints.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
