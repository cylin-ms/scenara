Include bi\u2011weekly milestones, owners, required inputs/outputs for each milestone, risk mitigation actions, and a timeline view. Align each deliverable and success metric with the mission charter, and reference the constraints (budget, compute quota, legal review, and cross\u2011team dependencies). Use the MMM framework (Mission, Milestone, Metric) to structure the plan and provide a concise executive summary for senior leadership.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
