  "workback_prompt": "Using the detailed scenario above (NovaTech\u2011DataPulse Extreme Integration), create a comprehensive work\u2011back plan that outlines all tasks, owners, dependencies, and timelines required to achieve the Day\u20111 priorities and the 100\u2011day integration objectives. Include milestones for each workstream (HR, IT, Finance, Product, Sales, Operations), risk mitigation steps, communication touch\u2011points, and a tracking mechanism for the $45M cost\u2011synergy and $30M revenue\u2011synergy targets. The plan should respect the constraints (budget $12M, legal close 15\u202fDec\u202f2025, regulatory approvals, overlapping contracts) and be presented in a format suitable for the Integration PMO to monitor progress daily.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
