Include all major work\u2011streams (strategy alignment, speaker coordination, venue & AV, catering, swag procurement, travel logistics, communications, on\u2011site execution, post\u2011event deliverables), key milestones, dependencies, owners, and estimated effort. Align the plan with the T\u201160 planning horizon, $120k budget, and the success criteria listed. Provide a Gantt\u2011style timeline (by week) and a risk mitigation matrix for the identified constraints.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
