Provide a Gantt\u2011style schedule with weekly checkpoints and risk mitigation steps.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
