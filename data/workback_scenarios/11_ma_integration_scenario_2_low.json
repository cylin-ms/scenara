  "workback_prompt": "Create a detailed, day\u2011by\u2011day workback plan for the AstraTech Solutions \u2013 MedPulse Health integration described above. The plan should cover all key workstreams (HR, IT, Finance, Product, Sales, Operations), map each deliverable to a specific date, assign owners from the stakeholder list, identify dependencies, flag critical path items, and embed the Day\u20111 and 100\u2011day priorities. Include risk mitigation actions, budget checkpoints, and communication milestones. Output the plan in a table format suitable for the Integration Management Office to track progress against the success criteria and constraints.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
