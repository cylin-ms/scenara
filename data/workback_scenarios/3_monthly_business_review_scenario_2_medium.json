The plan should start from T\u201130 (30 days before the meeting on 5\u202fDecember\u202f2025) and outline all tasks, owners, durations, dependencies, and required data sources needed to produce the deliverables listed. Include milestones for data extraction, deck creation, stakeholder reviews, budget approval steps, and contingency actions for the identified constraints. Format the output as a table or Gantt\u2011style list suitable for project tracking.\n\nGenerate a MEDIUM QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Most major tasks present but some gaps\n- Reasonable task descriptions\n- Some dependencies defined\n- Most tasks have owners\n- Milestones present but may lack detail\n- Generally realistic timelines\n- Some consideration of risks\n- Key deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits MEDIUM quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"medium quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",

This reduces duplicate updates and makes the critical path clear.\n2. **Weekly Sync (T\u201130 \u2192 T\u201110)** \u2013 Short 15\u2011minute stand\u2011ups focused on progress against the next two milestones (Data Extraction, Deck Outline). Owners report blockers; the PMO updates the schedule.\n3. **Feedback Consolidation** \u2013 All review comments are captured in a central \u201cFeedback Log\u201d with priority tags (Critical / Nice\u2011to\u2011have). The PMO filters the log before incorporating changes, keeping the freeze date intact.\n4. **Risk & Contingency Review** \u2013 At the start of each week, the PMO highlights any at\u2011risk tasks (e.g., data\u2011source latency) and confirms the contingency actions listed in Task\u202f20.\n5. **Stakeholder Sign\u2011off Gate** \u2013 Budget approval and executive sign\u2011off are treated as formal gates; the PMO sends a concise \u201cGate\u2011Ready Package\u201d (deck, budget summary, risk register) to the approvers to streamline decisions.\n6. **Backup Presenter** \u2013 Identify a secondary presenter (e.g., Senior Product Analyst) during the kickoff. If the primary presenter is unavailable on 5\u202fDec, the backup can step in using the same final deck.\n\nBy following the timeline above, keeping dependencies visible, and using the collaboration mechanisms listed, the team can deliver a complete, approved MBR deck on schedule while having clear actions ready if any constraint arises.",
