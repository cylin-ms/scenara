Include weekly tasks, owners, dependencies, risk mitigations, and required artifacts for each milestone (Weeks\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8). Align the plan with the success criteria, constraints, and the company\u2019s AI\u2011first Azure strategy. Output the plan in a tabular format (Week, Milestone, Deliverable, Owner, Dependencies, Risks, Mitigation).\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
