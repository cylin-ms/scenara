Include all pre\u2011work deliverables (market research, financial models, competitor analysis), facilitator preparation, logistics (travel, venue booking, catering), agenda development, breakout session planning, decision\u2011making checkpoints, post\u2011offsite communication rollout, and risk mitigation steps. Provide timelines, owners, dependencies, and milestones leading up to the offsite and through the first 30\u202fdays after the event, ensuring the success criteria and constraints listed in the scenario are met.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
