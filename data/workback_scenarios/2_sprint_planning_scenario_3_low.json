The plan should break down each deliverable into weekly milestones, identify critical path tasks, assign owners, list required dependencies (including external LabPartner API and design assets), outline risk mitigation for known blockers (e.g., PTO, security review timing), and provide a timeline view (day\u2011by\u2011day) that ensures all success criteria are met by the sprint end on 19\u202fMay\u202f2025.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
