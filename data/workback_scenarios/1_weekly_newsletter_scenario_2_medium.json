The plan should start from the send date (Friday, November 29, 2025, 09:00\u202fAM PST) and work backwards, covering all tasks, owners, durations, dependencies, and milestones needed to meet the deadline and success criteria outlined in the scenario.

Highlight any risk mitigation actions for the constraints (budget, compliance, and product\u2011release dependencies).\n\nGenerate a MEDIUM QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Most major tasks present but some gaps\n- Reasonable task descriptions\n- Some dependencies defined\n- Most tasks have owners\n- Milestones present but may lack detail\n- Generally realistic timelines\n- Some consideration of risks\n- Key deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits MEDIUM quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"medium quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",

  "analysis": "# Outcomes\n\n## Newsletter Send (Friday\u202fNov\u202f29\u202f2025\u202f09:00\u202fAM\u202fPST)\nFinal distribution of the Weekly GreenPulse Customer Success Newsletter to the subscriber list.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nThe send date is the fixed deadline given in the scenario. All upstream work must be completed and verified before this moment, making it the primary outcome that drives the entire work\u2011back schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. Confirm the final email file and tracking parameters are loaded into the ESP (Email Service Provider).  \n2. Verify the send queue is scheduled for the exact timestamp.  \n3. Ensure compliance sign\u2011off is recorded in the ESP\u2019s audit log.  \n4. Capture a \u201csend\u2011ready\u201d checkpoint as a milestone that triggers the post\u2011send reporting window.\n\n---\n\n## Content Draft Approved (Wednesday\u202fNov\u202f27\u202f2025)\nStakeholder\u2011approved copy for all newsletter sections (lead article, product updates, tips, CTA).  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nContent must be locked at least two days before send to allow design, build, and testing. The scenario lists \u201ccontent drafting\u201d and \u201cstakeholder reviews\u201d as required steps.\n\n### Approach\n- Writer delivers first draft to the Content Lead (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f5).  \n- Content Lead circulates draft to Product Marketing, Compliance, and Customer Success leads for review (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f4).  \n- Collect feedback, incorporate changes, and obtain formal sign\u2011off (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f3).  \n- Document approval in the shared tracker; mark the milestone \u201cContent Draft Approved\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Design Assets Completed (Tuesday\u202fNov\u202f26\u202f2025)\nAll visual elements (header image, icons, product screenshots, brand\u2011compliant templates) are finalized and exported.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nDesign must be ready before the email is built. The plan calls for \u201cdesign asset creation\u201d and a subsequent \u201capproval workflow\u201d.\n\n### Approach\n- Designer creates initial mock\u2011ups based on the approved copy (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f6).  \n- Conduct a quick internal review with Brand & Marketing (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f5).  \n- Iterate and export final assets in web\u2011ready formats (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f4).  \n- Store assets in the project folder and link them in the email build spec.\n\n---\n\n## Approval Workflow Completed (Monday\u202fNov\u202f25\u202f2025)\nAll required sign\u2011offs (Compliance, Legal, Product Marketing, Customer Success) are captured.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nThe scenario stresses compliance and product\u2011release dependencies. A consolidated approval step reduces risk of last\u2011minute rework.\n\n### Approach\n- Compile the final copy and design assets into a review package.  \n- Distribute to each approver with a 24\u2011hour deadline.  \n- Track responses in the approval tracker; follow up on any pending items.  \n- Once all approvals are logged, mark the \u201cApproval Workflow Completed\u201d milestone.\n\n---\n\n## Email Build & QA Finished (Friday\u202fNov\u202f22\u202f2025)\nFully assembled HTML email, integrated with tracking, and passed functional & rendering QA.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nThe email must be built after content and design are locked, then tested across devices and ESP preview tools before scheduling.\n\n### Approach\n- Email Developer imports copy and assets into the template (Day\u202f\u2011\u202f9).  \n- Add dynamic tags, UTM parameters, and accessibility attributes.  \n- Conduct internal QA (spell\u2011check, link validation).  \n- Run cross\u2011client rendering tests (Litmus/Email on Acid) and fix any issues.  \n- Upload final HTML to the ESP and tag as \u201cReady for Send\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Analytics & Tracking Setup (Thursday\u202fNov\u202f21\u202f2025)\nAll reporting metrics (open, click, conversion, unsubscribe) are configured in the ESP and BI dashboard.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nAnalytics must be ready before the email is sent to capture data from the first moment. The scenario lists \u201canalytics setup\u201d as a required task.\n\n### Approach\n- Define KPI list with Customer Success leadership.  \n- Create UTM conventions and embed them in the email content.  \n- Set up ESP tracking (open pixels, click redirects).  \n- Build a dashboard in the reporting tool; test with a sandbox send.\n\n---\n\n## Post\u2011Send Report Delivered (Monday\u202fDec\u202f2\u202f2025)\nPerformance summary shared with stakeholders, including insights and recommendations for the next issue.  \nArtifact references: *(none)*\n\n### Reasoning\nThe scenario calls for \u201cpost\u2011send reporting.\u201d Delivering the report within a few days keeps the team aligned for the next newsletter cycle.\n\n### Approach\n- Extract raw data from the ESP and BI dashboard (Day\u202f+\u202f1).  \n- Compile metrics, compare against benchmarks, and note any compliance or deliverability issues.  \n- Draft a brief report and circulate to Product, Marketing, and Customer Success leads (Day\u202f+\u202f2).  \n- Incorporate feedback and publish the final version (Day\u202f+\u202f3).\n\n---\n\n## Breakdown\n```\n1.
