  "analysis": "# Outcomes\n\n## 1. Core Feature Set Delivered  \nImplementation of the sprint\u2019s primary user\u2011facing functionality (e.g., \u201cPatient Summary\u201d page and \u201cLab Results\u201d view) and acceptance of the associated success criteria.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe sprint description emphasizes delivering a set of functional features that rely on internal code and the external LabPartner API. Those features are the central success criteria for Sprint\u202f7, so they constitute a primary outcome.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Clarify scope** \u2013 Product Owner confirms the exact list of UI components and backend services that belong to the \u201cCore Feature Set.\u201d  \n2. **Split work** \u2013 Front\u2011end and back\u2011end developers each take ownership of their layer, with the Integration Lead coordinating the API contract.  \n3. **Iterative build** \u2013 Build the UI mock\u2011ups first, then wire the API calls, followed by data\u2011model integration and validation.  \n4. **Validate** \u2013 QA runs functional tests against the definition\u2011of\u2011done checklist; the Product Owner signs off at the sprint demo.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. LabPartner API Integration Completed  \nSecure, tested connection to the external LabPartner API, including authentication, data mapping, and error handling.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe scenario calls out \u201cexternal LabPartner API\u201d as a required dependency. Without a working integration the core features cannot retrieve lab data, making this a critical path outcome.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Obtain credentials** \u2013 Integration Lead requests sandbox keys from LabPartner (Day\u202f1).  \n2. **Define contract** \u2013 Review API spec, create a mapping document, and get sign\u2011off from the backend developer (Day\u202f2).  \n3. **Implement wrapper** \u2013 Backend developer builds a thin service layer that abstracts the API calls (Days\u202f3\u20115).  \n4. **Security review** \u2013 Security Analyst checks the wrapper for token handling and data\u2011privacy compliance (Day\u202f6).  \n5. **Automated tests** \u2013 QA adds contract\u2011test suites to the CI pipeline (Day\u202f7).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Assets Integrated & Reviewed  \nAll UI mock\u2011ups, style guides, and component libraries delivered by the design team are incorporated into the codebase and reviewed for consistency.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe plan mentions \u201cdesign assets\u201d as a required dependency. Their integration is necessary before the front\u2011end work can be considered complete and must be reviewed to avoid rework.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Receive assets** \u2013 UI/UX Designer hands over final Sketch/Figma files (Day\u202f1).  \n2. **Component extraction** \u2013 Front\u2011end developer creates reusable React/Vue components based on the assets (Days\u202f2\u20114).  \n3. **Design review** \u2013 Design Lead conducts a walkthrough with the squad (Day\u202f5).  \n4. **Adjustments** \u2013 Minor CSS tweaks and accessibility fixes (Day\u202f6).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Security Review & Sign\u2011off  \nComplete the mandatory security assessment for the new code, including static analysis, dependency scanning, and data\u2011privacy checks, and obtain formal sign\u2011off.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe context flags \u201csecurity review timing\u201d as a known blocker. Securing sign\u2011off before release is a non\u2011negotiable sprint goal.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Pre\u2011scan** \u2013 Security Analyst runs SAST and dependency checks on the feature branch (Day\u202f8).  \n2. **Remediation** \u2013 Developers address any high\u2011severity findings (Days\u202f9\u201110).  \n3. **Formal review** \u2013 Security team conducts a walkthrough of the integration points (Day\u202f11).  \n4. **Sign\u2011off** \u2013 Security Analyst documents approval; the Scrum Master records it in the sprint board.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. End\u2011to\u2011End Testing & Acceptance  \nComprehensive functional, regression, and performance testing completed, with all critical bugs resolved and the Product Owner\u2019s acceptance criteria met.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nTesting is required to validate that the delivered features meet the sprint\u2019s success criteria and that the external API behaves under load.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Test case creation** \u2013 QA Engineer drafts test scenarios based on the Definition of Done (Day\u202f9).  \n2. **Automated suite execution** \u2013 Run unit, integration, and API contract tests in CI (Days\u202f10\u201111).  \n3. **Manual exploratory testing** \u2013 Focus on UI/UX flow and error\u2011state handling (Day\u202f12).  \n4. **Bug triage** \u2013 Developers fix any blockers; QA re\u2011tests (Day\u202f13).  \n5. **Final acceptance** \u2013 Product Owner signs off during the sprint demo (Day\u202f14).  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Sprint Review & Retrospective Delivered  \nPresent the completed work to stakeholders, capture feedback, and conduct a retrospective to identify improvement actions for the next sprint.  \nArtifact references: *(none provided)*  \n\n### Reasoning  \nA sprint cannot be considered complete without a review meeting and a retrospective. These activities close the loop on the sprint\u2019s objectives.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Demo preparation** \u2013 Squad assembles a short walkthrough deck (Day\u202f14).  \n2. **Stakeholder demo** \u2013 Product Owner leads the sprint review (Day\u202f15).  \n3. **Retrospective** \u2013 Scrum Master facilitates a discussion on what went well, challenges, and action items (Day\u202f15).  \n\n---\n\n# Breakdown  \n\n```\nSprint 7 (2 weeks) \u2013 6\u202fMay\u202f2025 \u2192 19\u202fMay\u202f2025\n```\n\n### Week\u202f1 (May\u202f6\u201110)\n\n| Day | Task | Owner | Dependencies | Notes |\n|-----|------|-------|--------------|-------|\n| Mon (6) | Kick\u2011off & scope confirmation | Product Owner | \u2013 | Align on Core Feature Set |\n| Mon (6) | Receive design assets | UI/UX Designer | \u2013 | Assets delivered to front\u2011end |\n| Tue (7) | Review LabPartner API spec & request credentials | Integration Lead | \u2013 | External LabPartner team |\n| Tue (7) | Create component library from design assets | Front\u2011end Dev | Design assets | Initial UI scaffolding |\n| Wed (8) | Implement API wrapper (auth, endpoints) | Backend Dev | API credentials | Secure token handling |\n| Wed (8) | Pre\u2011security scan (SAST) | Security Analyst | Code base (wrapper) | Identify high\u2011severity issues |\n| Thu (9) | Map API data to UI models | Backend Dev + Front\u2011end Dev | API wrapper | Data\u2011binding logic |\n| Thu (9) | Draft test cases (functional, API contract) | QA Engineer | Feature specs | |\n| Fri (10) | Conduct design review walkthrough | Design Lead | Component library | Sign\u2011off on UI consistency |\n| Fri (10) | Begin unit testing of API wrapper | Backend Dev | API wrapper | |\n| Fri (10) | Update sprint board with owners & status | Scrum Master | \u2013 | |\n\n### Week\u202f2 (May\u202f13\u201117)\n\n| Day | Task | Owner | Dependencies | Notes |\n|-----|------|-------|--------------|-------|\n| Mon (13) | Resolve SAST findings | Backend Dev | Pre\u2011scan results | Critical path |\n| Mon (13) | Continue UI integration (pages, navigation) | Front\u2011end Dev | Component library, API data mapping | |\n| Tue (14) | Run automated integration tests (CI) | QA Engineer | API wrapper, UI pages | |\n| Tue (14) | Prepare demo deck & talking points | Product Owner | Completed features | |\n| Wed (15) | Sprint Review (demo to stakeholders) | Product Owner | All outcomes | Acceptance sign\u2011off |\n| Wed (15) | Retrospective & improvement actions | Scrum Master | Review feedback | |\n| Thu (16) | Security formal review meeting | Security Analyst | Completed code, SAST cleared | |\n| Thu (16) | Address any security reviewer comments | Backend & Front\u2011end Devs | Security feedback | |\n| Fri (17) | Final regression & performance testing | QA Engineer | All features, security sign\u2011off | |\n| Fri (17) | Bug triage & last\u2011minute fixes | Developers | Test results | |\n| Mon (20) | **Buffer / overflow** (if needed) | Squad | \u2013 | Not counted in sprint but available for spill\u2011over |\n\n### Critical Path Summary\n1. **LabPartner API Integration** \u2192 must be functional before UI can display lab data.  \n2. **Security Review** \u2192 must be cleared before final acceptance.  \n3. **End\u2011to\u2011End Testing** \u2192 depends on both API integration and UI completion.\n\n### Risk Mitigation (Known Blockers)\n\n| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| PTO of key developers (e.g., Backend Dev) | Delays API wrapper & security fixes | Identify backup resource early; pair programming on critical days |\n| LabPartner API credential delay | Stops integration work | Request sandbox keys on Day\u202f1; maintain a fallback mock service |\n| Security review timing (external security team) | Could push sign\u2011off past sprint end | Schedule review meeting for Thu (16) and pre\u2011scan on Wed (8) to give buffer |\n| Unclear design assets | Rework on UI components | Conduct design review on Fri (10) and capture change requests immediately |\n\n### Timeline View (Day\u2011by\u2011Day)\n\n| Date | Milestone / Deliverable |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| 6\u202fMay (Mon) | Sprint kickoff, design assets received |\n| 7\u202fMay (Tue) | LabPartner API spec reviewed, credentials requested |\n| 8\u202fMay (Wed) | API wrapper prototype completed, pre\u2011security scan |\n| 9\u202fMay (Thu) | Data\u2011mapping defined, test cases drafted |\n| 10\u202fMay (Fri) | Design review sign\u2011off, unit tests started |\n| 13\u202fMay (Mon) | SAST issues resolved, UI pages built |\n| 14\u202fMay (Tue) | Automated integration tests run, demo deck ready |\n| 15\u202fMay (Wed) | Sprint Review & Retrospective (Stakeholder demo) |\n| 16\u202fMay (Thu) | Formal security review, remediation |\n| 17\u202fMay (Fri) | Final regression & performance testing, bug fix freeze |\n| 19\u202fMay (Wed) | **Sprint end** \u2013 all success criteria met, documentation archived |\n\n---  \n\nThis workback plan captures the major deliverables, assigns owners, outlines dependencies (including the external LabPartner API and design assets), identifies the critical path, and provides a day\u2011by\u2011day timeline that aligns with the sprint\u2019s end date of **19\u202fMay\u202f2025**.
