The VisionEdge Squad (6\u20118 members) is part of the Azure AI platform, operating under the MMM (Mission\u2011Metrics\u2011Milestones) framework. Mission statement: \u201cDeliver a low\u2011latency, high\u2011accuracy real\u2011time object\u2011detection API for edge devices that expands Azure AI\u2019s edge portfolio and drives 5,000 new developer sign\u2011ups in the first month.\u201d Duration: 8 weeks (T\u201156 to T\u20110). DRI: Priya Patel (Senior Program Manager, Azure AI Vision). Squad members: Alex Chen (Lead Software Engineer), Maya Singh (Data Scientist), Luis Gomez (UX Designer), Fatima Al\u2011Mansour (Cloud Infrastructure Engineer), Jenna Lee (QA Lead), Raj Patel (Partner Engineer \u2013 Azure IoT Hub). Cross\u2011functional roles include PM, Software Engineers, Cloud Engineers, UX, Data Science, QA, and Partner Engineering. Key milestones every 2 weeks: \u2022 Week\u202f2 (T\u201142): Requirements freeze & design sign\u2011off \u2022 Week\u202f4 (T\u201128): MVP prototype & internal demo \u2022 Week\u202f6 (T\u201114): Beta release to 20 pilot customers \u2022 Week\u202f8 (T\u20110): General Availability launch with full SDKs and launch marketing pack. Success metrics (quantitative): \u2022 End\u2011to\u2011end inference latency \u2264\u202f30\u202fms on Azure Edge VM \u2022 Model mAP \u2265\u202f92\u202f% on Edge\u2011device benchmark set \u2022 Cost per inference \u2264\u202f$0.001 \u2022 5,000+ active developer accounts within 30\u202fdays of GA \u2022 NPS \u2265\u202f70 from beta participants. The mission directly supports Microsoft\u2019s FY25 strategy to grow Azure AI revenue by 15\u202f% and to lead the edge\u2011computing market while meeting sustainability targets (\u2264\u202f0.5\u202fkg CO\u2082 per 1\u202fM inferences).",
