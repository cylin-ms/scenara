Include all major milestones, tasks, owners, dependencies, and dates starting from today (T\u201160) through the event dates (June 10\u201112, 2025) and post\u2011event deliverable deadlines. Highlight critical path items, risk mitigation steps, and required approvals. The plan should be formatted as a table or Gantt\u2011style list suitable for import into a project\u2011management tool.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
