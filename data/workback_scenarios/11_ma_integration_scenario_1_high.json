  "workback_prompt": "Using the detailed scenario above (NovaTech\u2011DataPulse Extreme Integration), create a comprehensive work\u2011back plan that outlines all tasks, owners, dependencies, and timelines required to achieve the Day\u20111 priorities and the 100\u2011day integration objectives. Include milestones for each workstream (HR, IT, Finance, Product, Sales, Operations), risk mitigation steps, communication touch\u2011points, and a tracking mechanism for the $45M cost\u2011synergy and $30M revenue\u2011synergy targets. The plan should respect the constraints (budget $12M, legal close 15\u202fDec\u202f2025, regulatory approvals, overlapping contracts) and be presented in a format suitable for the Integration PMO to monitor progress daily.\n\nGenerate a HIGH QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Comprehensive task coverage\n- Clear, actionable task descriptions\n- Well-defined dependencies\n- All tasks assigned to specific owners\n- Clear milestones with completion criteria\n- Realistic timelines with buffers\n- Proactive risk management\n- Complete deliverable list\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits HIGH quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"high quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",

  "analysis": "# Outcomes\n\n## 1. Day\u20111 Integration Ready\u2011State  \nAll critical work\u2011stream deliverables required for the legal close (15\u202fDec\u202f2025) are completed, tested, and signed\u2011off so that the combined entity can operate from day\u202f1 without disruption.  \nArtifact references: *none*\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe scenario explicitly calls for \u201cDay\u20111 priorities\u201d that must be in place at the moment of legal close.  Achieving this state is a prerequisite for any later 100\u2011day objectives and for protecting the $45\u202fM cost\u2011synergy and $30\u202fM revenue\u2011synergy targets.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Identify the Day\u20111 deliverables** for each workstream (HR, IT, Finance, Product, Sales, Operations).  \n2. **Sequence tasks** so that regulatory approvals, overlapping\u2011contract resolutions, and budget\u2011approval steps finish before the close date.  \n3. **Assign owners** (e.g., HR Lead, IT Lead) and set clear \u201cGo\u2011Live\u201d acceptance criteria (e.g., payroll migrated, core ERP data reconciled).  \n4. **Build a pre\u2011close gate\u2011review** (legal, compliance, finance) to certify readiness.  \n5. **Create a contingency buffer** of 5\u202fbusiness days for any last\u2011minute issue that could affect the close.\n\n---\n\n## 2. 100\u2011Day Integration Objectives  \nDeliver the post\u2011close work\u2011stream initiatives that generate the $45\u202fM cost\u2011synergy and $30\u202fM revenue\u2011synergy targets within the first 100\u202fcalendar days after legal close (by 24\u202fMar\u202f2026).  \nArtifact references: *none*\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user\u2019s request explicitly mentions \u201c100\u2011day integration objectives\u201d and the synergy targets.  These objectives are the core measure of integration success and must be broken into measurable work\u2011stream milestones.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Translate synergy targets** into concrete work\u2011stream KPIs (e.g., head\u2011count reduction, cloud\u2011cost consolidation, cross\u2011sell pipeline).  \n2. **Map each KPI** to a set of tasks, owners, and due dates that fit within the 100\u2011day horizon.  \n3. **Introduce weekly synergy\u2011tracking meetings** to compare actual vs. target numbers and trigger corrective actions.  \n4. **Allocate the $12\u202fM integration budget** across work\u2011streams, with a 10\u202f% reserve for unplanned synergy\u2011capture activities.  \n5. **Document completion criteria** for each milestone (e.g., \u201cCost\u2011synergy of $12\u202fM realized from shared services consolidation\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Daily Monitoring Dashboard & Tracking Mechanism  \nA single, PMO\u2011owned dashboard that is updated daily with task status, milestone progress, and real\u2011time tracking of cost\u2011 and revenue\u2011synergy realization.  \nArtifact references: *none*\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user wants a format \u201csuitable for the Integration PMO to monitor progress daily.\u201d  A living dashboard that aggregates all work\u2011stream data fulfills this need and provides the visibility required for risk mitigation.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Select a lightweight reporting tool** (e.g., shared spreadsheet, Power\u202fBI workspace) that can be refreshed automatically from source systems.  \n2. **Define data feeds**: task\u2011status (RAG), milestone dates, synergy\u2011capture metrics, budget spend vs. plan.  \n3. **Assign a Dashboard Owner** (Integration PMO Lead) and two data stewards (Finance Analyst, IT Ops).  \n4. **Set a daily update schedule** (02:00\u202fUTC) and a daily \u201cstand\u2011up\u201d snapshot email to all work\u2011stream leads.  \n5. **Build alerts** that trigger when variance exceeds 5\u202f% of schedule or synergy target.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Integrated Risk\u2011Mitigation & Communication Plan  \nA structured set of risk\u2011identification, mitigation actions, and communication touch\u2011points that keep stakeholders informed and enable rapid response to issues such as regulatory delays, contract overlaps, or budget overruns.  \nArtifact references: *none*\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe constraints (regulatory approvals, overlapping contracts, limited budget) create material risk.  A formal plan with owners, escalation paths, and scheduled communications is essential for the PMO to keep the integration on track.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Create a risk register** with categories (Regulatory, Legal, Financial, Operational, Cultural).  \n2. **Allocate owners** (Legal Counsel, Compliance Officer, Finance Lead, HR Lead).  \n3. **Define mitigation actions** and contingency budgets (e.g., $1\u202fM reserve for regulatory\u2011delay consulting).  \n4. **Schedule communication touch\u2011points**:  \n   - Weekly integration steering committee (Mon\u202f09:00\u202fUTC)  \n   - Bi\u2011weekly all\u2011hands (Wed\u202f15:00\u202fUTC)  \n   - Daily \u201cred\u2011flag\u201d email for any critical risk breach.  \n5. **Review and update** the risk register at each steering\u2011committee meeting.\n\n---\n\n# Breakdown\n\n## 1.
