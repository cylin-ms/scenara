The plan should list all required pre\u2011reads, data collection, slide deck creation, review cycles, approvals, logistics (venue, hybrid tech, catering), stakeholder briefings, and decision\u2011making workshops. Include milestones, owners, start and finish dates, dependencies, and any risk mitigation steps needed to meet the constraints and success criteria outlined in the scenario.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
