  "analysis": "# Outcomes\n\n## 1. API\u202fv2 Release (Core payment\u2011processing API)  \nDeliver a production\u2011ready API\u202fv2 that supports the new Velocity Payments features and meets PCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 security requirements.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none (derived from user brief)\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user explicitly listed \u201cAPI v2 release\u201d as a critical\u2011path item. Without this component the downstream design hand\u2011off, testing, and beta release cannot proceed, so it must be an Outcome with its own set of tasks, approvals, and owners.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Scope & specification finalisation** \u2013 Product Owner and API Engineer confirm the functional and security specs.  \n2. **Development sprint** \u2013 API Engineer (lead) with two backend developers builds the endpoints.  \n3. **Internal security review** \u2013 Security Engineer conducts a code\u2011level PCI\u2011DSS\u202f4.0 checklist review.  \n4. **Compliance sign\u2011off** \u2013 Compliance Lead obtains PCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 approval from the Compliance Committee.  \n5. **Staging deployment & smoke test** \u2013 Release Manager pushes to staging; QA Lead runs smoke tests.  \n6. **Release to production** \u2013 After sign\u2011off, Release Manager schedules the production cut\u2011over.  \n\nBuffer time of 2\u202fdays is built after the security review to absorb any remediation work. The total cost is tracked against the $45\u202fk budget (see budget note in the breakdown).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Design Hand\u2011off (UX/UI & integration diagrams)  \nProvide the finalized UI/UX designs and integration diagrams to the development team, ensuring they reflect the new API capabilities and PCI\u2011compliant flows.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \n\u201cDesign hand\u2011off\u201d is another critical\u2011path item. It must be completed before developers can start detailed implementation and before testing can be meaningfully scripted.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Finalize wireframes & high\u2011fidelity mocks** \u2013 UX Designer with Product Owner.  \n2. **Create integration diagrams** \u2013 Solution Architect maps UI actions to API\u202fv2 calls.  \n3. **Design review meeting** \u2013 All squad members (Product, Tech Lead, Compliance Lead) confirm that designs respect PCI\u2011DSS\u202f4.0 constraints (e.g., no sensitive data stored on client).  \n4. **Formal hand\u2011off package** \u2013 UX Designer uploads assets to the shared repository; Tech Lead signs off as \u201cdesign ready\u201d.  \n\nA 1\u2011day buffer is added after the review to incorporate any last\u2011minute compliance feedback.\n\n---\n\n## 3. PCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 Compliance Review  \nObtain formal approval that the new Velocity Payments feature set, including API\u202fv2 and UI flows, satisfies PCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 requirements.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \nPCI compliance is a mandatory gate before any beta or production release. It is listed as a critical\u2011path item, so it must be tracked as a separate Outcome with its own approvals and owners.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Self\u2011assessment checklist** \u2013 Compliance Lead completes the PCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 self\u2011assessment based on design and implementation artifacts.  \n2. **External audit (if required)** \u2013 Schedule a brief audit with the external PCI auditor (optional, depending on risk appetite).  \n3. **Remediation** \u2013 Development team addresses any findings (typically 1\u20132\u202fdays).  \n4. **Final sign\u2011off** \u2013 Compliance Committee issues the \u201cPCI\u202fDSS\u202f4.0 Approved\u201d certificate.  \n\nA 2\u2011day buffer is placed after the audit to allow for any remediation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Integrated Testing Cycle (Unit \u2192 Integration \u2192 End\u2011to\u2011End)  \nExecute a full testing suite covering unit, integration, and end\u2011to\u2011end scenarios, confirming that the system works end\u2011to\u2011end and remains PCI compliant.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \nTesting is required to reach the \u201cbeta release\u201d milestone. The plan must include weekly testing tasks, owners, and dependencies on the API release and design hand\u2011off.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Test plan creation** \u2013 QA Lead drafts test cases aligned with functional specs and PCI controls.  \n2. **Unit testing** \u2013 Developers write/execute unit tests during development (continuous).  \n3. **Integration testing** \u2013 QA Lead runs integration tests once API\u202fv2 is in staging and designs are handed off.  \n4. **End\u2011to\u2011end (E2E) testing** \u2013 QA Lead runs automated E2E scripts covering the full payment flow.  \n5. **Defect triage** \u2013 Tech Lead prioritises any failures; developers fix within the same sprint.  \n\nA 1\u2011day buffer is kept after each testing phase to address any high\u2011severity defects.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Beta Release (Limited internal/external users)  \nDeploy the new Velocity Payments feature to a controlled group of beta users for real\u2011world validation.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \nBeta release is a milestone that follows testing and PCI sign\u2011off. It provides an opportunity to surface usability or security issues before full production rollout.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Beta environment provisioning** \u2013 Release Manager creates a separate environment mirroring production.  \n2. **User selection & communication** \u2013 Product Owner identifies beta participants and sends onboarding instructions.  \n3. **Beta deployment** \u2013 Release Manager pushes the release candidate; QA Lead monitors health metrics.  \n4. **Feedback collection** \u2013 Product Owner aggregates feedback; Tech Lead assesses impact.  \n\nA 2\u2011day buffer is added after beta to incorporate any quick\u2011fix changes.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Production Deployment (Go\u2011Live)  \nLaunch the Velocity Payments feature to all customers, ensuring smooth cut\u2011over and post\u2011deployment monitoring.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe final outcome of the sprint is the production deployment. It depends on all prior outcomes (API release, design hand\u2011off, PCI approval, testing, beta validation).\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Release plan sign\u2011off** \u2013 All squad leads (Product, Tech, Compliance, Release) approve the go\u2011live checklist.  \n2. **Production rollout** \u2013 Release Manager schedules the deployment window (preferably low\u2011traffic period).  \n3. **Post\u2011deployment monitoring** \u2013 Ops Engineer watches key metrics (latency, error rates, PCI audit logs) for 48\u202fhours.  \n4. **Rollback contingency** \u2013 Documented rollback steps ready; Release Manager can trigger if critical issues arise.  \n\nA 1\u2011day buffer is reserved after go\u2011live for any immediate hot\u2011fixes.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Budget & Resource Tracking  \nMaintain visibility that the sprint\u2019s total spend does not exceed the $45\u202fk limit while delivering all required outcomes.  \n\n**Artifact references:** none\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user explicitly called out a $45\u202fk budget constraint. Tracking this as an Outcome ensures the plan includes regular cost reviews.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Initial cost estimate** \u2013 Finance Analyst (or Product Owner) breaks down labor and any external audit fees.  \n2. **Weekly spend review** \u2013 At each sprint stand\u2011up, the team compares actual spend to forecast.  \n3. **Variance mitigation** \u2013 If projected spend > $45\u202fk, re\u2011prioritise low\u2011impact tasks or negotiate scope reduction.  \n\nA small contingency of $2\u202fk is built into the estimate to absorb minor overruns.\n\n---\n\n# Breakdown\n\n```\nSprint 5 (2025\u201112\u201102 planning) \u2192 5 weeks (ending 2025\u201112\u201131)\nWeek 0 (Planning) \u2013 2025\u201112\u201102\nWeek 1 \u2013 2025\u201112\u201103 to 2025\u201112\u201109\nWeek 2 \u2013 2025\u201112\u201110 to 2025\u201112\u201116\nWeek 3 \u2013 2025\u201112\u201117 to 2025\u201112\u201123\nWeek 4 \u2013 2025\u201112\u201124 to 2025\u201112\u201130\nWeek 5 \u2013 2025\u201112\u201131 (buffer & final sign\u2011off)\n```\n\n### 1.
