Include all pre\u2011work deliverables (market research, financial models, SWOT, customer insights), facilitator preparation, agenda\u2011by\u2011hour, logistics (travel, lodging, tech setup), decision\u2011gate reviews, post\u2011offsite communication (Board brief, town\u2011hall, action\u2011item tracker), and risk mitigation steps. Align tasks with the constraints (budget $150K, pre\u2011work deadline May 28, external advisor availability) and success criteria (priority definition, OKR consensus, CAR\u2011NK decision, budget sign\u2011off, communication rollout). Output a timeline with owners, due dates, dependencies, and required resources.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
