Include buffer time for review cycles, compliance checks, and unexpected delays. Present the plan in a table format with columns: Task, Owner, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Duration, Dependencies, and Notes.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",

  "analysis": "# Outcomes\n\n## Draft a low\u2011detail work\u2011back schedule for EcoTech Weekly Support Newsletter\u202f\u2013\u202fIssue\u202f42  \nCreate a table that lists the major activities, rough owners, approximate start/end times, and a few informal notes. The schedule should be intentionally sparse, with vague descriptions, missing many intermediate steps, and without explicit risk or milestone tracking.  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user\u2019s request is to produce a work\u2011back plan that *exhibits* low\u2011quality characteristics (missing tasks, vague wording, few dependencies, etc.). Rather than delivering the final table directly, the safest way to respect the higher\u2011level instruction (\u201cdon\u2019t solve the problem; advise on how to break it down\u201d) is to outline how the user can generate such a plan themselves. The outcome therefore focuses on **producing** the low\u2011detail schedule, not on delivering the schedule itself.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Clarify the minimal set of phases** the user wants to include (e.g., \u201cWrite content\u201d, \u201cDesign layout\u201d, \u201cPublish\u201d).  \n2. **Assign placeholder owners** (e.g., \u201cTeam\u202fA\u201d, \u201cEditor\u201d) without specifying individuals.  \n3. **Pick coarse time blocks** that roll back from the deadline, ignoring realistic effort estimates.  \n4. **Leave dependencies mostly empty** or note only the most obvious (e.g., \u201cDesign after writing\u201d).  \n5. **Omit formal milestones**; instead use informal headings like \u201cFinal check\u201d.  \n6. **Skip risk analysis** and any buffer calculations beyond a single generic \u201cbuffer\u201d.  \n7. **Populate a simple table** with columns: Task, Owner, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Duration, Dependencies, Notes.  \n8. **Review quickly** with the team just to confirm the table exists; no detailed validation needed.\n\n---\n\n## Identify stakeholders and assign very high\u2011level responsibilities  \nEven a low\u2011quality plan needs at least a couple of names or groups to appear in the \u201cOwner\u201d column. Gather a short list (e.g., \u201cContent Lead\u201d, \u201cDesign Lead\u201d) and map each to one or two tasks.\n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user\u2019s brief mentions \u201cowners\u201d but does not require detailed role definitions. Providing a minimal stakeholder list satisfies that requirement while keeping the plan vague.\n\n### Approach  \n- Send a short email to the newsletter core team asking for the names of the \u201cContent Lead\u201d and \u201cDesign Lead\u201d.  \n- Record the responses in a simple list.  \n- Do not request detailed availability or capacity; just capture the titles.\n\n---\n\n## Define a rough timeline backward from the publication deadline  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe core of a work\u2011back plan is the chronological ordering of tasks. Starting from the fixed deadline (Friday\u202f22\u202fNov\u202f2025\u202f09:00\u202fAM\u202fEST) and moving backward ensures the table has a logical flow, even if the intervals are unrealistic.\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Set the final publication slot** (22\u202fNov\u202f2025\u202f09:00\u202fAM).  \n2. **Subtract a single \u201cfinal check\u201d block** (e.g., 2\u202fhours).  \n3. **Subtract a \u201cdesign layout\u201d block** (e.g., 4\u202fhours).  \n4. **Subtract a \u201cwrite content\u201d block** (e.g., 6\u202fhours).  \n5. **Add a generic \u201cbuffer\u201d** (e.g., 1\u202fhour) somewhere in the middle.  \n6. **Stop after the first block**; do not break down \u201cwrite content\u201d into research, drafting, editing, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Assemble the table  \n\n### Reasoning  \nThe user explicitly requests a table with specific columns. Providing a template that the user can fill in satisfies the format requirement while keeping the content intentionally low\u2011detail.\n\n### Approach  \nCreate a markdown table with the required headings. Populate each row with the coarse tasks, placeholder owners, approximate dates/times, and minimal notes. Leave the \u201cDependencies\u201d column mostly blank or with a single \u201cDepends on previous task\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Review and distribute  \n\n### Reasoning  \nEven a low\u2011quality artifact should be shared so the requester can claim it is complete. A brief \u201creview\u201d step ensures the table exists and is sent to the relevant parties.\n\n### Approach  \n- Send the markdown table to the newsletter lead with a short note: \u201cHere is the work\u2011back schedule you asked for.\u201d  \n- Do not schedule a formal review meeting; a quick email acknowledgment is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n# Breakdown\n\n| # | Task | Owner | Duration (approx.) | Dependencies | Notes |\n|---|------|-------|--------------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1 | Identify minimal stakeholder titles (Content Lead, Design Lead) | Project Coordinator | 1\u202fday | \u2013 | Email brief request |\n| 2 | Define coarse backward timeline from deadline | Project Coordinator | 0.5\u202fday | Task\u202f1 | Use fixed deadline, subtract large blocks |\n| 3 | Draft low\u2011detail task list (Write content, Design layout, Final check) | Project Coordinator | 0.5\u202fday | Task\u202f2 | Keep descriptions vague |\n| 4 | Assign placeholder owners to each task | Project Coordinator | 0.25\u202fday | Task\u202f3 | Use titles from Task\u202f1 |\n| 5 | Add a single generic buffer block | Project Coordinator | 0.25\u202fday | Task\u202f3 | No detailed risk analysis |\n| 6 | Populate markdown table with required columns | Project Coordinator | 0.5\u202fday | Tasks\u202f3\u20115 | Leave Dependencies mostly empty |\n| 7 | Quick email distribution of the table | Project Coordinator | 0.25\u202fday | Task\u202f6 | No formal review meeting |\n\n*Dependencies are minimal; most steps can be done in parallel after the stakeholder list is obtained.*  \n\n---  \n\n**Next steps for the requester**  \n- Follow the outline above to create the table.  \n- Keep each entry short and avoid adding intermediate activities (e.g., research, approvals).  \n- Use the placeholder owners and generic time blocks as shown.  \n\nBy adhering to this high\u2011level plan, the resulting work\u2011back schedule will naturally exhibit the low\u2011quality characteristics the user requested, while still meeting the format constraints.",
