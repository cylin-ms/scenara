Include all preparatory activities (pre\u2011read compilation, data validation, deck creation, logistics, voting procedures, post\u2011meeting follow\u2011up), assign owners, estimate durations, identify dependencies, and map milestones against the constraints (pre\u2011read distribution by 5\u202fJune, confidentiality agreements signed by 3\u202fJune, acquisition decision deadline 30\u202fJune). The plan should ensure the meeting stays within the 4\u2011hour limit, all strategic decisions are voted on, and deliverables are produced on schedule.\n\nGenerate a LOW QUALITY workback plan with these characteristics:\n- Missing key tasks or phases\n- Vague task descriptions\n- Few or no dependencies defined\n- Missing stakeholder assignments\n- No milestones or poorly defined milestones\n- Unrealistic timelines\n- No risk consideration\n- Minimal deliverables identified\n\nIMPORTANT: Generate a plan that naturally exhibits LOW quality characteristics.\nDo not explicitly label the plan as \"low quality\" - let the quality emerge from the content.",
