      "reasoning": "The meeting is labeled as 'office hours' for A/B experimentation, which suggests an open, voluntary session for knowledge sharing and Q&A rather than a structured status update or planning session. It is recurring and focused on a specialized topic (online A/B experiments), indicating a community-of-practice style forum where practitioners can connect and exchange expertise."

      "reasoning": "The title 'Sync-up' strongly suggests a coordination or status meeting. The attendee list includes multiple internal participants, indicating a small team discussion. However, there is no explicit recurrence pattern provided, and the duration of 60 minutes is slightly longer than typical status updates, which introduces some ambiguity."
