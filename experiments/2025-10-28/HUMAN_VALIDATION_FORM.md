2. Meeting #___ should be: __________________________ because: __________________
3. Meeting #___ should be: __________________________ because: __________________

### Taxonomy Gaps
Are there any meeting types YOU would classify these as that are NOT in the current taxonomy?

- [ ] No, all my types are covered
- [ ] Yes, I would add: ___________________________

### Difficulty Rating

## Quick Analysis (For You to Complete)

**Your Type Accuracy** = (Meetings you agree with) / 8 = ___%

**Your Category Accuracy** = (Meetings in correct category even if wrong type) / 8 = ___%

**Estimated LLM Accuracy** based on your assessment: 
- GPT-5: ___%

## Key Questions for Validation

1. **Meeting 1** ("[Async Task]"): Is this Informational OR Status Update?
   - If Informational: GPT-5 wins
   - If Status Update: Copilot wins
   - If ambiguous: Both valid

2. **Meeting 3** ("Meeting Prep STCA Sync"): Is "Prep" more important than "Sync"?
   - If "Prep" dominates: Copilot correct (Planning)
   - If "Sync" dominates: GPT-5 correct (Status Update)

3. **Confidence Calibration**: Do the high-confidence meetings (96-99%) match your high-confidence assessments?

4. **Edge Cases**: Meeting 1 and 3 show model disagreement - are these genuinely hard to classify?

**Next Step**: After you complete this form, we can calculate ACTUAL accuracy against YOUR expert judgment!

This will tell us:
- Are the models reliable?
- Where do they make mistakes?
- Should we improve the prompt for specific patterns?
