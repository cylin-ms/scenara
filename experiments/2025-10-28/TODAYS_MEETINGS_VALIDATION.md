## SUMMARY - Your Results

### Quick Count
- **Meetings I agree with GPT-5**: _____ / 8
- **Meetings I agree with GitHub Copilot**: _____ / 8
- **Meetings where both models are correct**: _____ / 8
- **Meetings where both models are wrong**: _____ / 8
- **Genuinely ambiguous meetings**: _____ / 8

### Accuracy Calculation
```
GPT-5 Accuracy = (Meetings you agreed with GPT-5) / 8 × 100% = _____%
GitHub Copilot Accuracy = (Meetings you agreed with Copilot) / 8 × 100% = _____%
Cross-Model Agreement = 7/8 = 87.5% (already calculated)
```

### Key Findings
1. **Most confident correct classification**: Meeting ___ (___________)
2. **Most confident incorrect classification**: Meeting ___ (___________)
3. **Hardest meeting to classify**: Meeting ___ (___________)

### Common Error Patterns (if any)
- [ ] "[Async Task]" blocks misclassified
- [ ] "Meeting Prep" vs "Sync" confusion
- [ ] "Office Hours" category unclear
- [ ] Other: _________________________________________________

### Overall Assessment
- [ ] Models are performing well (accuracy ≥ 80%)
- [ ] Models need improvement (accuracy < 80%)
- [ ] Taxonomy needs clarification for: _______________________
- [ ] Some meetings are genuinely hard to classify

## NEXT STEPS

**Based on your validation**:

1. **If accuracy ≥ 87.5%**: Cross-model agreement = actual accuracy ✅
   - Centralized prompt is working well
   - Models are production-ready
   - Focus on edge cases (e.g., "[Async Task]")

2. **If accuracy 70-87%**: Models mostly correct ⚠️
   - Identify specific error patterns
   - Refine prompt for those cases
   - Re-run experiments

3. **If accuracy < 70%**: Systematic issues ❌
   - Major prompt refinement needed
   - Review taxonomy clarity
   - Consider additional context signals

**After completing this form**:
- Save your responses
- We'll analyze error patterns together
- Refine the prompt based on your feedback
- Re-run classification if needed
