   - **Master document** with complete analysis findings
   - Meeting ranking tool implementation framework
   - Signal detection rules and algorithms
   - Integration strategy with Meeting Extraction Tool

## 🎯 Purpose

The Priority Calendar system aims to create **intelligent meeting ranking and prioritization** by analyzing multiple signals:

- **Organizer relationships** (user, manager, team)
- **Meeting types** (1-on-1, strategic, social, etc.)
- **Attendance requirements** (required, optional, tentative)
- **Historical patterns** (past important meetings)
- **Timing factors** (urgency, conflicts, energy levels)

## 🔗 Integration

This system is designed to work with the **Meeting Extraction Tool** to create a complete meeting intelligence pipeline:

```
Meeting Extraction → Priority Ranking → Smart Calendar Views → Automated Decisions
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement Meeting Ranking Tool** using signals and framework from analysis
2. **Create unified scoring algorithm** combining both systems
3. **Build user interface** for ranked calendar views
4. **Add learning capabilities** for personalized prioritization

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Ranking Accuracy**: User agreement with top-3 priorities
- **Time Savings**: Reduced scheduling decision time
- **Calendar Quality**: Improved meeting value and outcomes
- **User Adoption**: Active usage of ranking features
