    "reasoning": "The task requires multi-constraint reasoning: finding a 1-hour slot within 2 weeks, prioritizing over 1:1s and lunches, respecting Kat's schedule, ensuring in-person attendance, and booking a room. Current AI can handle basic scheduling via calendar APIs (Google, Outlook), but prioritization logic, conflict resolution, and physical room booking introduce complexity. Access to all participants' calendars and room availability is essential, which is often restricted by permissions and organizational policies.",

      "Multi-party availability coordination",
      "Preference hierarchy (override 1:1s and lunches)",

  "verification_ease": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Verification is straightforward: check if the scheduled event meets all explicit constraints (participants, duration, time window, in-person, room assigned, respects Kat's schedule). This can be programmatically validated against calendar data and meeting metadata.",
    "verification_methods": [
      "Compare scheduled event participants to requested names",
      "Check event duration and date range",
      "Validate room resource attached to event",
