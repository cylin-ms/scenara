# High-Impact Persona Targeting Strategy

**Author**: Chin-Yew Lin  
**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Identify personas who benefit most from each prompt to maximize user value and adoption

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Insight**: Not all personas benefit equally from each prompt. Target the **highest pain → highest relief** personas first for maximum impact and advocacy.

**Strategy**: For each prompt, identify personas with:
1. **High Pain**: Problem is acute, frequent, costly
2. **High Receptivity**: Recognize the problem, willing to adopt solutions
3. **High Influence**: Champions who drive broader adoption

**Expected Outcome**: 
- 20-30% of personas drive 70-80% of value
- Focus on "desperate" users → Build passionate advocates
- Word-of-mouth from champions accelerates adoption

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Build High-Impact Personas First (Week 1)

**Focus on Tier 1** (12 personas):
- Engineering Manager variants (3)
- Sales Manager variants (2)
- Executive variants (4)
- High-volume coordinators (2)
- Product Manager variant (1)

**Why**: These drive 60-70% of adoption and value

### Phase 2: Add Tier 2 for Diversity (Week 2)

**Add 10-11 personas**:
- Senior ICs (4)
- New leaders (3)
- Customer-facing (3)

**Why**: Ensures model generalizes beyond just overloaded managers

### Phase 3: Edge Cases for Robustness (Week 2)

**Add 7-8 personas**:
- Edge cases (4)
- Specialized roles (3)

**Why**: Prevents model from breaking on unusual patterns

### Validation: User Research Confirmation

**Before full persona generation, validate with 10-20 real users**:

1. **Interview high-impact personas**: "What's your biggest calendar pain?"
2. **Validate importance criteria**: "What makes a meeting important to you?"
3. **Confirm priority frameworks**: "What are your top 3-5 priorities?"
4. **Verify RSVP patterns**: "When do you decline meetings?"

**Expected outcome**: 85%+ confirmation that high-impact personas match real pain

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Adoption Metrics (With Targeted Personas)

| Metric | With Targeted Personas | With Random Personas | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Initial Adoption Rate** | 60-70% | 30-40% | +75% |
| **Active Usage (30 days)** | 50-60% | 20-30% | +100% |
| **Advocacy (NPS >9)** | 40-50% | 10-20% | +150% |
| **Word-of-Mouth Referrals** | 30-40% | 5-10% | +300% |

### Why Targeting Works

**Targeted Approach**:
- ✅ Solve for desperate users → High adoption
- ✅ Desperate users become advocates → Viral growth
- ✅ Advocates have influence → Org-wide rollout
- ✅ Success stories drive sales → Revenue

**Random Approach**:
- ❌ Solve for average user → Lukewarm reception
- ❌ Lukewarm users don't evangelize → Slow growth
- ❌ No clear success stories → Hard to sell

---

## Key Insights

### 1. **CRITICAL CORRECTION: High Pain = High Stakes = High Accuracy Required**
- ❌ **WRONG ASSUMPTION**: "Users with extreme pain will tolerate 70% accuracy"
- ✅ **REALITY**: Users with extreme pain (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) have HIGH STAKES → Need 85%+ accuracy
  - Sales Manager missing customer call prep = lost $100K deal
  - VP unprepared for board meeting = career damage
  - Engineering Manager missing performance review prep = team attrition
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Desperate users will churn faster if tool fails (trust is fragile)
- ✅ **Strategy**: Pre-train on oracle data to achieve 75-80% baseline, THEN launch to high-stakes users

### 2. **The Accuracy-Pain Paradox**
| User Pain Level | Accuracy Required | Tolerance for Errors | Launch Strategy |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Extreme) | **85%+** | Very low (high stakes) | Launch AFTER pre-training (Month 3+) |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High) | **80%+** | Low | Launch after initial feedback (Month 4+) |
| ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium) | **75%+** | Medium | Launch with oracle baseline (Month 2+) |
| ⭐⭐ (Low) | **70%+** | High (low stakes) | Safe for early alpha (Month 1) |

**Implication**: We CANNOT launch to desperate users (Tier 1) first with 70% accuracy. Must build accuracy first, THEN target high-stakes users.

### 3. **Revised Launch Strategy: Accuracy-Gated Rollout**
**❌ Original (Flawed) Plan**:
- Month 1: Launch to Tier 1 (desperate users) at 70% accuracy
- Result: Churn, damaged trust, negative word-of-mouth

**✅ Corrected Plan**:
- **Month 1-2**: Pre-train on oracle data (75-80% accuracy)
- **Month 2-3**: Alpha with Tier 3 (low-stakes users) - Build to 80% accuracy with real feedback
- **Month 3-4**: Beta with Tier 2 (medium-high stakes) - Build to 85% accuracy
- **Month 4-6**: Launch to Tier 1 (high-stakes users) - Only when 85%+ accuracy proven
- **Result**: Tier 1 users see reliable tool, become advocates instead of churning

### 4. **Influence Multiplies Impact**
- Engineering Managers influence 5-10 other managers (peer effect)
- Sales Managers influence sales org (10-20 people)
- VPs/Executives unlock budget + org adoption
- **10-15 high-influence users = 100-200 user adoption**
- ⚠️ **BUT**: Negative word-of-mouth from failed high-stakes user = 10-20 users lost

### 5. **Receptivity ≠ Error Tolerance**
- ❌ **WRONG**: "Receptive users tolerate errors"
- ✅ **CORRECT**: Receptive users adopt quickly IF accuracy is sufficient
- Tool-savvy personas (PMs, sales) adopt fast but churn fast if quality is poor
- Skeptical personas (senior ICs) are slow to adopt but sticky if they do

### 6. **Multiple Prompt Value Creates Stickiness**
- Managers benefit from Organizer-2 + Organizer-1 + Collaborate-1
- High total impact score (16-18/20) = sticky users
- **Bundle value across prompts for same persona**

### 7. **20% of Personas Drive 80% of Value (But Need 85% Accuracy)**
- Tier 1 (12 personas) = 60-70% of potential adoption
- **But only if accuracy meets their high-stakes threshold (85%+)**
- Tier 2 (10 personas) = 25-30% of adoption (need 80%+)
- Tier 3 (8 personas) = 5-10% of adoption (can tolerate 70-75%)
- **Invest in accuracy BEFORE targeting Tier 1**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Week 1: Build Tier 1 Personas** (12 high-impact)
   - Focus on overloaded managers and executives
   - Detailed importance criteria and priority frameworks
   - Generate 200 meetings each → 2,400 high-quality examples

2. **Week 2: User Research Validation** (10-20 interviews)
   - Confirm pain levels with real users
   - Validate importance criteria and priorities
   - Adjust personas based on feedback

3. **Week 2: Add Tier 2 Personas** (10 complementary)
   - Senior ICs, new leaders, customer-facing
   - Ensure diversity without diluting focus
   - Generate 150 meetings each → 1,500 examples

4. **Week 3: Edge Cases** (8 robustness)
   - Unusual patterns (timezone, burnout, fractional)
   - Generate 100 meetings each → 800 examples
   - **Total: 4,700+ high-quality training examples**

### Success Criteria (REVISED)

- ✅ **60%+ of training data from Tier 1 personas** (high-impact patterns)
- ✅ **85%+ of Tier 1 personas validated by real user interviews**
- ✅ **Model achieves 75-80% accuracy on oracle data** (pre-training baseline)
- ✅ **Model achieves 85%+ accuracy before Tier 1 launch** (high-stakes requirement)
- ⚠️ **DO NOT launch to Tier 1 until 85%+ accuracy proven** (churn risk)

### Corrected Long-Term Strategy (Accuracy-Gated Rollout)

**Phase 0 (Months 1-2): Pre-Training**
- Generate oracle data (focus 60% on Tier 1 personas)
- Train on 4,700+ synthetic examples
- Achieve 75-80% baseline accuracy
- **NO real users yet** (build accuracy first)

**Phase 1 (Month 2-3): Alpha with LOW-STAKES Users (Tier 3)**
- Launch to edge cases, specialized roles (low-stakes)
- Collect 500+ feedback events from users who can tolerate 75% accuracy
- Fine-tune to 80-85% accuracy
- **Validate reliability before high-stakes launch**

**Phase 2 (Month 3-4): Beta with MEDIUM-STAKES Users (Tier 2)**
- Launch to senior ICs, new leaders (medium stakes)
- Collect 1,000+ feedback events
- Fine-tune to 85%+ accuracy on Tier 2 patterns
- **Prove high accuracy to build confidence**

**Phase 3 (Month 4-6): Production Launch to HIGH-STAKES Users (Tier 1)**
- **ONLY AFTER 85%+ accuracy proven** on Tier 2
- Launch to overloaded managers, executives (high stakes)
- Collect feedback, continue improving to 90%+
- Build passionate advocates (tool is reliable by now)
- **Success stories from Tier 1 drive org-wide adoption**

**Phase 4 (Months 7-12): Scale and Optimize**
- Full org rollout (all tiers)
- 90%+ accuracy maintained
- Tier 1 advocates drive viral growth

## Conclusion (REVISED WITH CRITICAL CORRECTION)

**Targeted persona generation is critical for RLHF success, BUT accuracy requirements are INVERTED from initial assumption**:

### The Critical Mistake We Almost Made

**❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION**: "Desperate users will tolerate low accuracy (70%)"
- Logic: High pain → Willing to compromise on quality
- Result: Launch to high-stakes users with 70% accuracy → Immediate churn

**✅ CORRECT UNDERSTANDING**: "Desperate users REQUIRE high accuracy (85%+)"
- Reality: High pain = High stakes → Mistakes are costly (lost deals, career damage)
- Result: Build to 85%+ accuracy FIRST → Then launch to high-stakes users → Advocacy

### Revised Strategy Framework

1. **Accuracy-Gated Rollout**: Low-stakes users (Tier 3) → Medium-stakes (Tier 2) → High-stakes (Tier 1)
   - NOT the reverse (which would cause churn)

2. **Focus on Tier 1 pain for TRAINING DATA** (not for alpha launch):
   - 60% of oracle data from Tier 1 patterns
   - Model learns high-stakes use cases
   - BUT test with low-stakes users first

3. **Build advocates through RELIABILITY**: Tier 1 users become champions only if accuracy is 85%+
   - High pain + High accuracy = Passionate advocacy
   - High pain + Low accuracy = Angry churn + negative word-of-mouth

4. **Influence multiplies impact (if accuracy is sufficient)**:
   - 10-15 Tier 1 advocates = 100-200 user adoption
   - 1 failed Tier 1 user = 10-20 users warned away

5. **Oracle strategy enables this**: Pre-train on Tier 1 patterns to reach 75-80% baseline
   - Then alpha with Tier 3 to reach 85%+
   - Then launch to Tier 1 with proven reliability

**Key Numbers (CORRECTED)**:
- **60% of training data** from Tier 1 personas (learn their patterns)
- **BUT 0% of alpha users** from Tier 1 (too risky at 75% accuracy)
- **Month 4+**: Launch to Tier 1 only after 85%+ accuracy proven
- **Result**: 60-70% Tier 1 adoption (vs 10-20% if launched too early)

**Next Steps**: 
1. Generate Tier 1-weighted oracle data (Week 1-3)
2. Pre-train to 75-80% accuracy (Month 2)
3. Alpha with Tier 3 to reach 85% (Month 2-3)
4. Beta with Tier 2 to prove reliability (Month 3-4)
5. Launch to Tier 1 with confidence (Month 4-6)
