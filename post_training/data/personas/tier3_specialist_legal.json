  "work_style": "Legal Specialist - Contracts: Focused on contract reviews and compliance with 3-4 years experience. Spends 8-12 hours/week in meetings, primarily contract reviews and legal consultations. Work is deadline-driven (contract signatures, compliance deadlines) but generally planned with advance notice. Values clear meeting agendas and legal context - avoids meetings without defined legal need. Balances transactional work (contract reviews) with advisory work (legal consultations). Comfortable working independently with periodic team check-ins. Known for thorough contract reviews and pragmatic risk assessment.",
  "career_stage": "3-4 years into legal career, developing specialized expertise in commercial contracts. Building reputation as reliable contract reviewer. Career growth depends on: (1) Handling complex enterprise deals, (2) Building business relationships, (3) Developing specialized knowledge. Success metric: Complete contract reviews within SLA, no major contract issues escalating. Risk: Becoming bottleneck for deals. Opportunity: Handle strategic enterprise contracts, expand to new legal areas (IP, privacy).",
  "stress_level": "⭐⭐ LOW-MODERATE: 8-12 hour meeting weeks, work is important but rarely urgent emergencies. Deadlines are known in advance. Missing meeting = delayed review but can usually reschedule. Lower stakes than sales or executive roles. Comfortable environment for alpha testing - can tolerate 70-75% accuracy without major risk.",
  "notes": "KEY INSIGHT: Legal specialists are Tier 3 because stakes are lower - missing meeting = delayed review but not lost deal or career risk. Work is deadline-driven but predictable. Perfect for alpha testing - low risk if tool makes mistakes, can provide valuable feedback for improvement."
