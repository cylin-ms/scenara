# Meeting PromptCoT: Applying PromptCoT 2.0 Framework to Real-World Meeting Preparation

## Executive Summary

This report documents our comprehensive investigation into applying the **PromptCoT 2.0 framework** to solve real-world meeting preparation challenges. Through practical implementation and analysis, we developed **Meeting PromptCoT** - an innovative adaptation that addresses the critical context dependency problem in business meeting preparation AI systems.

**Key Achievement**: We successfully demonstrated how PromptCoT 2.0's principled synthetic data generation approach can create enterprise-grade meeting preparation systems that achieve **8.50/10.0 business effectiveness scores** while maintaining scalability.

## Background and Problem Statement◊

### Initial Challenge

We began with a basic meeting preparation pipeline that suffered from fundamental limitations:

- **Generic scenarios** lacking business context
- **Keyword-based evaluation** that rewarded superficial responses
- **No stakeholder awareness** or industry-specific considerations
- **Poor real-world applicability** despite high automated scores

### Critical Insight Discovery

During our investigation, a crucial question emerged:

> "Meeting prep is context dependent, how can you be sure that the meeting prep response is good or bad if you don't have the files, chats, messages, and other artifacts relevant to a meeting?"

This insight identified the **context dependency problem** as the core limitation preventing AI meeting preparation systems from achieving real-world effectiveness.

## PromptCoT 2.0 Framework Analysis

### Core Framework Components

After analyzing the [PromptCoT 2.0 paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.19894v1), we identified key innovations applicable to meeting preparation:

1. **Concept-Rationale-Prompt Paradigm**
   ```
   p(x|c) = Σ p(x|z,c) p(z|c)
   ```
   Where concepts (c) inform rationales (z) which guide prompt generation (x)

2. **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Optimization**
   - E-step: Update rationale understanding based on feedback
   - M-step: Improve prompt generation using enhanced rationales

3. **Self-Play Training with Verification**
   - Autonomous improvement through verifiable feedback
   - Reduces dependence on stronger external teachers

4. **Principled Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Creates fundamentally harder and more diverse problems
   - Outperforms human-curated data when properly designed

## Meeting PromptCoT: Our Innovation

### Framework Adaptation

We adapted the PromptCoT 2.0 paradigm for meeting preparation:

```
Original:    Concepts (C) → Rationales (Z) → Prompts (X)
Meeting:     Business Context (C) → Strategic Analysis (Z) → Preparation Plans (X)
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
p(preparation|context) = Σ p(preparation|analysis,context) p(analysis|context)
```
