## Key Insights

### Dormancy Patterns

1. **Post-mortem Meeting Cluster** (June 23):
   - 5 collaborators last contacted during same Post-mortem meeting
   - Suggests team transition or project completion
   - Group: Xiuge Cheng, Zili Qu, Ling Chen, Xiaojie Zhou, Steven Zeng

2. **One-on-One Relationship Loss**:
   - Zhuoyu Zhang: Regular 1-1s stopped after June 10
   - Peng Zhang: Sync meetings ceased after July 1

3. **Risk Distribution**:
   - 8 HIGH risk (90+ days dormant)
   - 0 MEDIUM risk (60-89 days)
   - All dormant relationships exceed 90 days

### Validation Results

‚úÖ **No False Positives Detected**:
- Haidong Zhang: Correctly shown as ACTIVE (106 meetings, last today)
- Xiaodong Liu: Correctly shown as ACTIVE (16 meetings, last 7 days ago)
- Xiaojie Zhou: Correctly shown as DORMANT (last contact 125 days ago)

### Data Quality

- **Total Events Analyzed**: 267 meetings (April-October 2025)
- **Attendees Field**: Present in 100% of events
- **Classification Method**: Keyword-based (70-80% accuracy)
- **Dormancy Threshold**: 60 days since last contact
- **High Risk Threshold**: 90 days since last contact

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority Dormant)

1. **Re-engage with Zhuoyu Zhang**:
   - 12 meetings indicates strong historical relationship
   - 138 days dormant - longest gap
   - Recommended: Schedule 1-1 to reconnect

2. **Follow-up on Post-mortem Group**:
   - 5 people all went dormant after June 23 meeting
   - May indicate project transition
   - Recommended: Check if continued collaboration needed

3. **Review Peng Zhang Sync**:
   - Regular sync meetings stopped
   - Recommended: Determine if relationship should continue

### System Improvements

1. **Automated Dormancy Alerts**:
   - Weekly scan for relationships approaching 60-day threshold
   - Alert at 45 days to enable proactive re-engagement

2. **Relationship Health Dashboard**:
   - Track active vs dormant trends over time
   - Identify patterns in relationship loss

3. **Re-engagement Templates**:
   - Pre-written messages for different dormancy scenarios
   - One-on-one reconnection vs group follow-up
