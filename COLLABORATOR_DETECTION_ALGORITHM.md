**Version**: 8.0_document_sharing_enhanced  
**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025  
**Platform**: Scenara 2.0 Enterprise Meeting Intelligence System

---

## Overview

The Collaborator Detection Algorithm is a multi-source, temporally-aware system that identifies, ranks, and monitors professional relationships based on calendar meetings, Teams chat interactions, document sharing, and Microsoft Graph API intelligence. It combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis to provide actionable collaboration insights.

---

## Core Architecture

### Multi-Source Data Integration

The algorithm synthesizes data from **four primary sources**:

1. **Calendar Events** (70% weight)
   - Meeting attendance patterns
   - Meeting type classification (31+ categories)
   - Temporal recency (7/30/90/180 day windows)
   - One-on-one vs group dynamics
   - Organized vs attended meetings

2. **Microsoft Graph API** (15% weight)
   - People API ranked collaborators (ML-powered)
   - Organizational hierarchy data
   - Job title and role verification
   - Cross-validation of relationships

3. **Teams Chat** (5% weight)
   - One-on-one vs group chat frequency
   - Message recency (7/30/90 day windows)
   - Chat-only collaboration detection
   - Ad hoc communication patterns

4. **Document Sharing** (5% weight)
   - OneDrive direct and group sharing
   - Teams chat file attachments
   - Sharing continuity (multi-day patterns)
   - Temporal recency bonuses

5. **Confidence Level** (5% weight)
   - Multi-source verification
   - Data quality indicators
   - Evidence consistency checks

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Data Extraction & Filtering

**Calendar Event Processing**:
```python
# Line 1369 in collaborator_discovery.py - CRITICAL FILTERING
attendees = [
    att.get('emailAddress', {}).get('name', 'Unknown')
    for att in attendees_data
    if att.get('emailAddress', {}).get('name')
    and att.get('type') != 'resource'  # Exclude conference rooms
]
```

**Key Features**:
- **Metadata-Based Resource Filtering**: Uses Graph API `type` field
  - `"required"` / `"optional"` = Person (INCLUDE)
  - `"resource"` = Conference room, equipment (EXCLUDE)
- **Language-Agnostic**: No keyword matching - 100% reliable
- **Applied at Extraction**: Ensures clean data for all downstream processing

**7-Month Calendar Analysis**:
- Date Range: April 2025 - October 2025 (267 events)
- Complete attendee data with type metadata
- Extracted via SilverFlow with `--select` parameter

---

### 2. Meeting Classification

**31+ Meeting Types** using keyword-based classification (70-80% accuracy):

**High-Value Meetings** (High collaboration signal):
- One-on-one meetings
- Small collaborative working sessions (2-8 people)
- Planning/decision meetings
- Workshop/training sessions
- Performance reviews

**Medium-Value Meetings** (Moderate collaboration signal):
- Team meetings
- Status updates
- Informational briefings
- Project reviews

**Low-Value Meetings** (Weak collaboration signal):
- Large broadcasts (50+ people)
- All-hands meetings
- Email distribution lists
- System notifications

**Classification Method**:
- Subject line keyword analysis
- Attendee count thresholds
- Organizer patterns
- Meeting duration heuristics

---

### 3. Temporal Recency Scoring

**Philosophy**: Recent important collaboration > Old frequent collaboration

**Time Windows & Multipliers**:
```
Last 7 days:   2.0x (HOT)     - "I just met with them"
Last 30 days:  1.5x (RECENT)  - "We're actively collaborating"
Last 90 days:  1.2x (CURRENT) - "Regular collaboration"
Last 180 days: 0.8x (MEDIUM)  - "Occasional collaboration"
> 180 days:    0.5x (DECAY)   - "Historical collaboration"
```

**Important Meeting Recency Bonus**:
- Important + Recent (< 30 days): +1.3x multiplier
- Important + Medium (< 90 days): +1.1x multiplier
- Recent important meeting: +10 points each

**Temporal Scoring Values**:
- Last 7 days: 15 points per meeting
- Last 30 days: 8 points per meeting
- Last 90 days: 4 points per meeting

---

### 4. Collaboration Quality Analysis

**Genuine Collaboration Detection**:

**Indicators** (weighted scoring):
- One-on-one meetings: High weight (direct engagement)
- Small working meetings (2-8 people): High weight
- Organized meetings: Medium weight (leadership signal)
- Cross-source validation: Graph API + Chat + Documents

**Filtering Rules**:
- Broadcast meetings (50+ people): Filtered as noise
- Email distribution lists: Excluded
- Conference rooms: Excluded via `type` field
- Self-collaboration: Excluded (49 instances filtered)
- Former employees: Excluded (2 instances filtered)

**Genuine Ratio Calculation**:
```python
genuine_ratio = genuine_meetings / total_meetings
```
- High ratio (>0.5): Strong genuine collaboration
- Medium ratio (0.2-0.5): Mixed collaboration
- Low ratio (<0.2): Mostly broadcast attendance

---

### 5. Multi-Source Evidence Requirements

**Evidence Types**:
1. **Calendar Evidence**: ≥2 meetings with genuine collaboration
2. **Chat Evidence**: Recent Teams chat activity
3. **Document Evidence**: Shared documents (OneDrive/Teams)
4. **Graph API Evidence**: Ranked in top 10 by Microsoft's ML

**Dual Filtering Paths**:

**Path A: Calendar-Based Collaborators** (Strict):
- Minimum 2 meetings
- ≥20% genuine collaboration ratio
- Final score > 15 points
- Evidence: Calendar + (Chat OR Documents OR Graph API)

**Path B: Multi-Source Only** (Lenient):
- Chat-only OR Document-only OR Graph-verified
- Final score > 5 points
- Evidence: At least one non-calendar source
- Examples: Chat discussions, document sharing, Graph API ranking

**Result**: Captures both formal (meetings) and informal (chat/docs) collaboration

---

### 6. Importance Scoring (v8.0)

**Component Weights**:
```
Collaboration Activities:  25% (genuine meetings, 1:1s, organized)
Interaction Quality:       20% (genuine ratio, meeting types)
Temporal Recency:          15% (recent important meetings)
Graph API Ranking:         15% (Microsoft ML verification)
Confidence Level:          20% (multi-source verification)
Document Sharing:           5% (OneDrive + Teams attachments)
Teams Chat:                 5% (implied in quality/confidence)
```

**Scoring Formula**:
```python
importance_score = (
    0.25 * collaboration_score +    # Meetings, 1:1s, organized
    0.20 * quality_score +          # Genuine ratio, meeting quality
    0.15 * temporal_score +         # Recent activity
    0.15 * graph_api_score +        # ML ranking boost
    0.20 * confidence_score +       # Multi-source verification
    0.05 * document_score           # Document sharing
)
```

**Final Score**:
```python
final_score = sum(meeting['base_score'] for meeting in meetings)
            + graph_api_boost
            + document_points
            + chat_points
```

---

### 7. Graph API Integration

**People API Ranking Boost**:
```python
# Top 10 Graph API collaborators receive score boost
rank_1:  +19 points
rank_2:  +18 points
rank_3:  +17 points
...
rank_10: +10 points
```

**Verification Benefits**:
- Job title confirmation
- Organizational context
- Cross-validation of calendar data
- Confidence boost: +0.3 to confidence score

**Example**: Haidong Zhang
- Graph API Rank: #2 → +18 points
- Job Title: "PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT"
- Confidence: 1.00 (perfect validation)

---

### 8. Dormancy Detection

**Fast Calendar Scan Algorithm**:

**Purpose**: Identify collaborators requiring re-engagement

**Method**:
1. Scan 7 months of calendar data (267 events)
2. Track last contact date for each collaborator
3. Calculate days since last interaction
4. Classify risk level

**Thresholds**:
```
0-59 days:    ACTIVE          (Current collaboration)
60-89 days:   MEDIUM RISK     (Attention needed)
90+ days:     HIGH RISK       (Re-engagement required)
```

**Performance**: <5 seconds for 7-month analysis

**Output**:
- Active collaborators: 59 people
- Dormant collaborators: 8 people (all HIGH RISK, 90+ days)
- Total: 67 collaborators

**Dormant Examples**:
1. Zhuoyu Zhang: 375.0 score, 12 meetings, 90+ days inactive
2. Xiaojie Zhou: 180.2 score, 10 meetings, 90+ days inactive
3. Xiuge Cheng: 218.2 score, 11 meetings, 90+ days inactive

**Use Case**: Separate display for targeted re-engagement campaigns

---

### 9. Conference Room Filtering

**Problem**: Conference rooms appearing in collaborator rankings

**Old Solution** (Fragile):
```python
# Keyword-based filtering - DEPRECATED
keywords = ['conf room', 'conference room', 'room ', ...]
```
- Language-dependent
- Misses variations
- Unreliable across cultures

**New Solution** (Robust):
```python
# Graph API metadata-based filtering - PRODUCTION
att.get('type') != 'resource'
```

**Graph API Type Values**:
- `"required"`: Required person attendee ✅
- `"optional"`: Optional person attendee ✅
- `"resource"`: Conference room, equipment ❌

**Advantages**:
- Language-agnostic (works for all naming conventions)
- 100% reliable (Microsoft-controlled field)
- Future-proof (API metadata standard)
- Early filtering (line 1369 - affects all downstream)

**Results**:
- Removed: "Conf Room 4/3.1E (6)" (was #10)
- Removed: "Conf Room 4/3.1A (8)" (was #13)
- Total filtered: 3 conference rooms
- Adjusted rankings: Xiaodong Liu #14 → #12

### 10. Active/Dormant Separation

**Two-Stage Process**:

**Stage 1: Dormancy Detection**
```python
# tools/fast_dormancy_detection.py
for collaborator in all_collaborators:
    days_since_last = calculate_days_since_last_contact(collaborator)
    if days_since_last >= 90:
        dormant_list.append(collaborator)
    else:
        active_list.append(collaborator)
```

**Stage 2: Separate Ranking**
```python
# show_top_20_with_dormant_separation.py
active_ranked = rank_collaborators(active_list)
dormant_ranked = rank_collaborators(dormant_list)

display_top_20(active_ranked)  # Focus on current priorities
display_dormant(dormant_ranked)  # Re-engagement targets
```

**Business Value**:
- Active list: Current collaboration priorities
- Dormant list: Relationship maintenance opportunities
- Targeted engagement: Different strategies for active vs dormant
