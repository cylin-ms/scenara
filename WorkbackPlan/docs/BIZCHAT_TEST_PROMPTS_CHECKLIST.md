## Analysis Workflow

After collecting all DevUI links:

# For each DevUI link, export the session data
# Save as: data/contextflow_sessions/session_<type>_<date>.json
```

### Step 2: Extract Tool Usage
```bash
cd /Users/cyl/projects/scenara/WorkbackPlan

# Process all sessions
python tools/integrate_contextflow_tools.py \
  --batch-process data/contextflow_sessions/ \
  --update-registry \
  --output-report reports/devui_tool_usage_report.md
```

### Step 3: Generate Comparison Report
```bash
# Compare tool usage across meeting types
python tools/compare_tool_usage_by_type.py \
  --sessions data/contextflow_sessions/ \
  --output reports/tool_usage_by_meeting_type.json
```

### Step 4: Validate Training Data

# Ensure training data uses only real tools
python tools/validate_tool_usage.py \
  --tool-registry docs/bizchat_tool_registry.json \
  --training-data data/workback_planning_examples.json
```

## Notes

- **Priority Order**: Run high-complexity meetings first (1-4) as they likely use more tools
- **DevUI Links**: Capture immediately after each session before they expire
- **Tool Observations**: Note any unexpected tools or error patterns
- **Session Quality**: If a session fails or produces poor results, mark in notes and retry
- **Batch Processing**: After capturing 3-5 sessions, do a preliminary analysis to verify tool extraction is working
